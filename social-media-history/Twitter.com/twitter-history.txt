If I'm treated as a guest, I will act as one: I will not overstay my welcome, and eventually leave...
If people then ask, why I am leaving, what else to reply than with a sincere thank you for the hospitality and good care regarding my temporary stay.

Do we need Simone and Sartre back, in times of increasing technocracy, and maybe more and more the demand for a new social system?
