The horses pulling the chariots, the different social classes performing their rituals according to the ruling social constructs, the clouds moving slowly in the sky.<br>And as I sit, taking a look to the right, I see her thinking again. Her legs crossed, the right over the left. Leaning on her arms that are lying crossed on her legs, while looking in the distance, deep in thought. Always like this, I can tell when she is in her own world, analysing, building thought constructs, mapping them over the things in the real world in front of her. Gone in a world I can only imagine. But what I know from experience, being in the presence of this magnificent and beautiful woman, is that soon she will wish to share her insights, her conclusions, her architecture, her creation... She will give me an invitation to step for a moment in her world. Explaining me her mathematically demarcated space in which she positions everything and everybody. To then start describing the dynamics she recognises in the real world and how she maps those in that space. The dynamics that describe the real world, and fuel her thinking of a social system that will adhere to the rules of nature, the boundaries formed by these dynamics and the needs and desires of the people, she wishes that social system to cater for. All I can do is input my view of what she conveys, from a philosophical point of view. What is said by the big thinkers from the past about what she claims? How does the world work? What is morally right and what wrong? What is an ideology without a good rhetoric?</p><p name="61e5" id="61e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then she starts moving. First her eyes, squeezing them together slightly, to then start moving her body a little back, and then turning to her left, towards me. Looking in my eyes with a look of kindness and understanding, respect and love, her hands with palms up pointing towards me, like she wishes to give me something, she starts: “Paul, …”</p><p name="c298" id="c298" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And so she starts. All that was left in my hands was the little pencel, having my notebook already on the table because I knew I would not be focussed on anything else soon, but her, and her rhetoric describing something new she discovered. Now that we started discussing, I put my pencil down, to fully focus on her, and the discussion that had commenced. As we discuss, while I try to understand her ideas, my ideas regarding social systems, the combination of an ideology, a set of social constructs and the way they work together as one whole, are activated in my mind, but this time through the framework she is describing me. With this new view, perception if you will, I look around. Then I see this older looking man walking in front of me and the people sitting next to me. This man with his old looking suit, his white mustache, his hat, and that shy, looking away manner. Not expressing any form of awareness of his impact on his environment, this local social impact, like ripples in a lake emanating from a swan making her way through the water. Unlike this swan, elegant, a posture representative of what her appearance implies, this man behaves more like a branch broken from a tree after a strong autumn storm. By accident having ended up here, thinking he deterministically became this cause of impact in the situation we find ourselves in. The situation that is formed not only by his presence, his suit, but also of course what the suit implies or even better, represents. A social construct that is part of a certain social system. A system consisting of a set of social constructs, the description of how they relate to each other, and the ideology behind it, the legitimisation and defence of why this whole, this construct works to keep order in society and make it work. A social system, in the end, of course does not only serves a country, a nation, the world filled with humans, to make society work, but also, and more importantly maybe, keeps the majority happy. Preventing revolutions, chaos, war…<br>I predict because of this shyness, that this man is not going to indulge me, with a rhetoric of choice, defending the ideology he stands for, and because of which he has chosen this morning to wear this suit. Instead, I predict he will defend himself, and yes I assume here he will see my inquiries as a possible undermining of his social status that he has to defend, by trying to make the point that he is socially surviving in a society in which he merely likes to fit in. He will argue that wearing a suit is not coming from any ideology or expressing something in particular. It is a piece of cloth, without any consequences arising as a side effect from how a suit looks, what it means in society, nor what possibly is interpreted by the audience, the people witnessing a suit walking by, what wearing a suit means. Or if so, he cannot be held responsible for the consequences. For example, if it earns respect for wearing a suit, or you gain a privileged position in society due to wearing a suit, by maybe being helped more forthcoming at the public office, with more kindness, more willingness or just a cup of coffee where someone else, in workers clothes, would not, just because people are there own little politicians, that will try to enforce the social constructs they perceive should be in place, due to there personal political stance on which social systems should be enforced and which ones not in society. And depending on their role in society, being more or less successful at doing this. It is very easy to reap the benefits of using social constructs in your favour, but then denying that you act because of a social construct of which its ideology you politically favour when there are negative (social) consequences attached to defending said ideology. He might now have found a little escape: Acting according to a social construct, of which you know it will give you benefits, but doing so for the benefits, without having any ideology you stand for as a reason to choose that social construct. Another problem is when people choose a social construct without defending choosing it with the ideology they deem to be behind it and legitimising it, but then expecting society to anyway defend and enforce the social construct. It is this that makes me angry seeing how this man is presenting himself in combination with something else I see happening in this situation.</p><p name="388d" id="388d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A young boy comes closer and as he is going, looking dirt poort, barely wearing any shoes, he looks literally up to this man. He, although still very young, is already fully aware of the social construct behind wearing a suit, the suit itself, and how society carries the weight of enforcing the rules of the social system behind social constructs. He knows he can get negative consequences in the form of lower social status, bad standing in the community and therefore less chances in society to reach self actualisation and thereby reaching a higher social economic status, by simply not respecting these rules.</p><p name="02cb" id="02cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem here, that makes me angry, is that on the one hand, social systems, by the social constructs they consist of, gives order and makes society work. But on the other hand, they can create designed inequality, privilege to groups in society, unfair treatment, pain… A social system becomes a necessary evil if you have no better system, and it is known that it causes the above negative side effects. If one is not aware of what a social system is, nor that it is the reason for inequality, one might blame the privileged groups. But are these groups to blame? At the very least, these privileged groups should have the ability to self actualise properly, be aware of this situation, and defend the ideology of it and the base ideology of using social systems to begin with. It should be clear that defending an ideology, is letting it evolve. Like a virus entering a host, infecting it, is evolving the virus by way of being changed in the cells of the targeted host, the ideology is recreated by a person, which changes it a little in the process of interpreting it and presenting it again, after which it evolves further by way of the dynamic of using rhetoric.<br>This, however, should be an ideology in itself: Evolving social systems should be a responsibility everybody carries, and be aware of, by way of being aware of any social construct in place, carried by society, and having an ideology in place defending the choice to use a social construct. This ideology should always be presented implicitly in conversations, or ready to be presented and defended if asked to explicitly, but politely in the public conversations.<br>The question is, how true is the claim of this man, that he has no choice? Is he not free to choose anything else, then the social construct, to socially survive, or at least choose maximum outcome of the situation, by which he can give back to society most efficiently? I believe it can be proven that although you come up with good arguments, because you are free you are always responsible for your choices. Only then will this engine of progress of society, of human culture truly start running. What else is there then to help this engine become more effective and powerful as a human being? What else of a purpose can one find? All else would imply consumption at the cost of the human race. But this might be a musing for another time…</p><p name="5497" id="5497" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The insight that responsibility for our choices, comes from freedom in the situations we find ourselves in, is not only an insight one would possible want to put on a tile on the bathroom wall, but moreover a necessity in the context of upholding the philosophy of Simone next to me. Her system is the system of systems. But without the proof that people are accountable because they are responsible, it will not be possible to convince people why it is the way forward.</p><p name="26f7" id="26f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It is thanks to Simone, that I come to these conclusions right now. She shows me by explaining her view, this necessity of proofing that the freedom people have, comes at this great cost.<br>As I let my frustration, maybe even anger go, and become aware of where I am, and the company I find myself in, sitting next to this beautiful creature, the phenomena, this puzzle of a woman that seems to have more on her mind then she wishes to share with me. Her deep insights in these systems, society, our Zeitgeist. All I need to know is that she knows me, and that she loves me. And I do...</p></div></div></section>
