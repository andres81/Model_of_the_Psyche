Apart from maybe being more sensitive and spiritually engaged with what we don’t see but have to believe in, to have it as a part of our lives. I had been in love and had my heart broken a few times, but nothing serious I had experienced. Understandably looking at my age of course, but it should be noted that it does not exclude the possibility of real love. There are couples out there, married, happy, living their lives, having met at sixteen.</p><p name="63cb" id="63cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was the fourth year of high school. The year that all students could choose where to go on a school trip. France, skiing or Prague. I chose Prague. Didn’t speak German nor French enough to go there, and Prague seemed must more interesting. The fifth of April, 1998, we would take off and go by bus. And so we went. I wasn’t feeling very happy due to illness in my family, my grandfather having passed away not long before, and feeling overall depressed. Motivation was far away to go on this trip, but sometimes you have to give an experience a chance before you judge and miss out on an experience of a life time. A life changing event that could give you more than you have ever imagined. Little did I know, that that was exactly what was about to happen…</p><p name="3f86" id="3f86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After an hours long trip, we finally arrive at the hotel. We get out, grab our bags, and with a few classmates go to our rooms. After going 13 stairs up, finally arriving at the door to our room. Having arrived late, we all wanted to go down to the hotel bar and drink a nice cold beer. After 25 years I still clearly remember the lobby of the hotel, and the entrance to the bar. The moment we walked in, I scanned the place, as one does, acquiring some situational awareness. As I look around the place, a not so big room with a bar, a dancing area and some tables and chairs, I see a group of girls at the far end of the room, sitting at a long table. One girl immediately catches my attention. She seems out of place. A beautiful girl that somehow looks brighter, kind and interesting. Someone, you know by just looking, that you can have a decent conversation with. Even if it is just friendly, socially, no strings attached, worth investing time and energy in starting and maintaining a conversation, in which one can muse about what comes to mind. The experience of that other persons rhetoric, reasoning, view of things alone leaving a lasting memory. Enriching ones experience of life with the idea of that other person existing the way she does.<br>After looking around, I sit down with my classmates. But we want beer, so I go to the bar and order a couple of beers. As I do that, and wait for the waiter to serve me, a girl from the group I witnessed before, comes to me, and asks me where I am from. I introduce myself, tell her I’m from Holland, after which I learn she is from Belgium. She invites me to sit with them, so I do. We talk about the schooltrips we are on, where we are from. I learn they are from a girl school, and are on a school trip through Europe. At that moment the girl I saw before, when I entered the bar, sits down next to me on the left. Not showing any interest in my as the other girls had done, by sitting with her back towards me, I realise I won’t be having this. I will start a conversation and will invite her to a context we both will be content with in which we talk to get to learn each other better.</p><p name="b1f6" id="b1f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I tap her on the shoulder and she turns towards me. I start talking about who I am and ask her some questions, but she gives merely short answers. Understandably of course, but I don’t give up that easily. I keep talking and carrying the conversation. As long as she is listening, I don’t see a reason to stop. But then, she relaxes, and is relieved I don’t have the intentions like that of some other men she met while staying there. She talks enthusiastically and is motivated to getting to know each other better. We share to each other where we live, what we do, and how long we are staying there. A beautiful first evening of this school trip.</p><p name="02f1" id="02f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The next day, Monday, after a long day visiting places, I go to the bar in the hotel again. She greets me, asks if I remember her, to which I reply that I naturally remember her and am happy to meet again. We talked the whole evening. About what we did, where we went, how it was. It turned out we both visited the same places, in the same order. That evening we started to trust each other more and in my experience we felt both that this was real. It was the evening during which we switched from casually exploring who the other person is, to getting to know each other better on a deeper level. I experienced this as a very natural process and I remember being very calm and becoming truly comfortable with her. I started to experience the trust in her, you develop when you know you can trust someone with your emotions. The trust you can have in someone, that will be critical of your emotions, but respects them. No jokes, no implied insult, no preconceived view of who the other is nor a projection of a social construct that limits the range of emotions one is allowed to experience, with the implied thread of otherwise being socially controlled through exclusion, shame, humiliation… you name it. She was honest, but respectful. Understanding, but critical. Nourishing, but not smothering, nor belittling.<br>At the end of the evening, when it was time to go take some night sleep, we checked with each other again how long we were staying there, and when we would have to say goodbye. Two more evenings was the conclusion. Good to keep in mind.</p><p name="f63c" id="f63c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tuesday, another long day being out and seeing places. A beautiful cathedral, huge, impressive. Prague, the city itself, where I walked for long periods just experiencing the city, just waiting for the evening to come and talk together again. When it was finally evening, it was rather quiet and empty. She was not there. Did they maybe already leave instead of the day after tomorrow? Was this it? After a few hours, all of a sudden she was there, greeting me, and we had a little left to catch up. They had gone somewhere as a group, eating together. I was alright with any reason why she was later this evening, as long as we were together and we could talk again.</p><p name="3f36" id="3f36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wednesday… That day that I will never forget, and gave me a trauma to enjoy for 25 years to come.<br>It was a normal day, out again, not mingling a lot with my classmates, they went there own way. I didn’t feel much like hanging out with them. I had other things on my mind. That evening, talking together again, we were becoming a little more silent. We knew this was the last evening. And we knew it was alright, at least that is how I experienced it. After sitting most of the evening talking together, all of a sudden she stands up, and walks away. Fast, little bit stressed, without a word. I doubted myself if I had said something wrong, but as she grabbed her coat, and walked back towards me, she asked if I would walk with her. So I did. We came to a staircase going down. She walked down, and all of a sudden a teacher pushed me back: Go dancing. I had had a couple of beers already, and was disorientated due to this. I saw her turn around looking at me and I will never forget her eyes, distressed, fear. She asked can I have your details. I am an internal processor, so I stand there thinking. My thinking takes too long for their comfort and the teacher next to her starts pulling her with her down the stairs, she tries to stop it by saying she still wishes to talk to me, but the teachers want nothing of it. Not allowing me to ever see her again…</p><p name="7b79" id="7b79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After this, I feel the pain. Not knowing I will feel that pain for the coming 25 years. This memory, this painful experience, will be in the way of relationships, my trust in emotional connections with others, make me remember this event every year around April, and not letting me live my life. Causing emotional and psychological problems, pain, anxiety, you name it. But why? I shared this with a psychologist, who concluded of course this had been traumatising. But a trauma is not the same as an emotional wound. Why could no one help me? Why didn’t people listen to me to the extend that would heal me of the emotional wound and take away the trauma? What was the nature of the beast, of this trauma, that behaved as a black hole only expressing itself through the side effects of its gravity, the huge emotional wound that would stay in orbit of this trauma, not moving further along its natural path, the path of healing and dissolving of the damage that was done?<br>But also, why didn’t the teachers give more space for two young people to be together? “We don’t want them pregnant”? In my opinion this was an example of not taking the emotions and psychological health serious of young people. Yes, we were only 16 and 15. But I know people that are together, married, and met at that age. On top of that, what is the damage now done? Of course, these days we have mobile phones, internet, and what not. This can hardly ever happen again. But treating young people this immature, aggressive, and intrusive, comes in many forms. Let this story, based on truth, at least be a call to change. Changing the way we treat young people, treat them with respect, show them they are part of society, that their emotions are respected, that they will be treated as equals and not second rank civilians with no social status at all, just having to listen and respecting the authority of any random adult.</p><p name="2ea2" id="2ea2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After 25 years, now in 2023, I can finally say that the trauma is gone, and the emotional wound is healed. I am letting go and saying goodbye to the pain and emotional blockages that were present. To the memory of what happened then in 1998. And to the hope of this being ever resolved, some final closure. It started this year with remembering her name that I apparently had suppressed all this time. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, that name came back. Another thing that happened, was this awareness, all of a sudden, this thought that came into my mind, that this year this trauma would be resolved.<br>A lot was happening, spiritually, at the end of 2022 for me. Things I might someday write about. But in short, not only this trauma was healed, but others too, with the help of some spiritual intervention. For which I am forever grateful! One evening, 15 January, 2023, the pain came back, but this time more severe. I was wondering why this memory all of a sudden came back so clear pushing so hard. As if someone was giving it energy. This time I remembered everything more clearly, and with more details. Details I had forgotten about. Every iteration of going over what had happened, I started seeing more, and blanks were filled. I remembered more of what she had said and especially the details of when she was pulled away. The pain became so strong and intense, that I came to the point of giving up. I didn’t had energy anymore. I became very pessimistic and started feeling very depressed. This had never happened before so severe. Later that evening I sat down to watch some series. While watching, all of a sudden, one of the battery powered lights in the Christmas tree was turned on. It had 8 modes, and you had to press 8 times to get through all modes. It turned on and immediately was at mode 8. I stared at it, surprised, but brushed it off as something technical. I turned my head back to the left and watched the telly again. A few seconds later, the second lights switched on. Two independent lights being turned on? Some electromagnetic waves responsible for this? While watching the tree, the third lights were turned on… That was the moment I thought that it must be paranormal in nature, and it startled me a bit. As I think this over how this could have been possible, three lights, proper quality, battery powered, never having done this before, nor never ever after this event, I turn my head again back to the telly, just before my view is back on the telly, out of no where, I see something I will not write about here. But I can say it shook me enough to be frozen in place. But what happened due to this, somehow the trauma I suffered from was gone. I realised after this, that the trauma that had formed, was due to my experience of projecting my pain of loosing her, onto her. Due to what happened, she felt at least the same pain that I felt, and that was out of my control. I felt responsible for giving her that pain. Giving the person that amount of pain, that had been part of this beautiful experience we had together, is a common cause for psychological trauma. That trauma had always been in the way of letting the emotional wound heal. The cause of the trauma had been invisible, because it was suppressed. I couldn’t accept that I was responsible so the root cause could therefore not be identified nor scrutinised by way of therapy to take it out of my system. Somehow these events of the Christmas tree lights, plus what happened a few seconds after, this spiritual intervention, uncovered this root cause, took it away, and releaved me of the pain. After that evening it took me days to process everything and finally feel relieved completely of this burden.</p><p name="5b47" id="5b47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wish to call out to all psychotherapist that this story might reach. Please, take the calls from your clients more serious when they are about emotional pain, wounds, etc… Indeed, normally they need to heal by themselves, but if emotional wounds are kept in place by psychological trauma, and the root cause if hidden or kept away from the surface, out of self protection, it is yóur job to help to identify it and take it out. This starts with trust, and construct a safe environment. What I found is that the subconscious will test the environment for safety. What I also found, is that psychotherapists are not really good in seeing through this. If you become critical and/or belittling about expression of emotions: “Don’t you have friends to share this with…?” The test then has failed, and the start of expressing the trauma stops. You can’t state that it isn’t your responsibility to heal emotional wounds, and therefore you don’t have to explore it with the client. When in fact, that cry for exploration and attention of the client, is in fact a censored form of sharing the psychological trauma, for which exactly you are being payed for. You have to proof you are not acting in bad faith, not taking responsibility for exploring whether or not there is trauma, and therefore possibly extending the period a client is in need of therapy because the trauma keeps the pain in place that is the reason for the client to seek help.</p><p name="b25d" id="b25d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Then a final message to you, who I owe this beautiful experience to, that showed me what true love can be. An experience that changed my life forever, in a good way. You showed me that two persons can truly align, find each other through conversation, and how that feels. A feeling I never experienced ever after and don’t expect to feel again. Never again experiencing this bond that was forming between us, so powerful, and although in such a short time, felt real and that could last a lifetime. I celebrate you as a person and your kindness. Your integrity, that you expressed that moment we met and I first spoke with you, not making it easy to start a conversation between us. Your beautiful personality, that I saw in how eloquent you expressed your opinion. Your sincere interest in me and how you let me know your appreciation and respect for my emotions, my vulnerabilities, without losing the expression of being critical, making me feel truly appreciated for who I was and how you saw me. I can only hope you have not had the traumatising experience I have had, and that you found your life partner that makes you happy. That you live your life as you want to, that you are happy and have grown to the extend of self actualisation. I wish you all the best and that you are happy and grow old and make many happy memories. I truly owe you a lot, I will never forget that, nor will I ever forget you. This year, the 5th of April, till the 9th, I will only think of the pleasant memories of us being together, one last year. After 25 years, finally a resolution. If not in this life, see you in heaven!</p></div></div></section>
