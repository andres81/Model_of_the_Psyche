# Rules of Engagement Framework

## Introduction

This is a description of the Rules of Engagement Framework. This is a system
that one can use to effectively partake in any meeting or engagement of any kind
with any other person(s) on this planet. If one reads the previous, one must be
immediately triggered by that claim: Any person, and effectively. Most of us
will have had the experience of having to deal with "difficult" or "obtrusive" 
people, that didn't make it possible to have a successful meeting that could be
described as fruitful. However, this framework not only promises to give one the
tools to be effective and successful, but moreover become immune to psychosocial
attacks, exclusion, confusion and frustration and a lot more negative
experiences. Trust the author, he is a professional (in what...? BS-ing?).

The framework consists of a set of layers. The highest layer is layer 1. The
deeper you go, layer after layer that you descent, the higher the number of the
layer. That is not only convenient for the author to add layers at his disposal
and not having to update all those numbers everytime he does that, but it also
is an indication of the difficulty level of processing and dealing with that
particular layer.
Each layer is an addition to the understanding of what you're dealing with as a
reader: The world of phenomena we call reality. (And yes... read that book
"L'Être et le Néant").

## Minimal Situation

The minimal situation can be described as a situation that cannot be simplified
more. But in addition, it is a situation that serves to reach certain goals for
a person, of which the person is fully aware. If it is not useful for a person
in any possible way, it is simply a situation.

The requirements to call a situation a minimal situation:

1. It is a situation
2. It serves a certain set of goals for the participant for whom it is a
   minimal situation.
3. It cannot be simplified further, or be consisting of fewer characteristics, 
   without losing the functionality for the participant to reach a certain set
   of goals.
4. It is a situation with other participants: People, entities, AI... 
   Any intelligent, engaging party present and part of the situation.

### Examples of the Minimal Situation

1. Sitting in a bus.
   This situation is to start with nothing but a situation: A concept relating
   to a position (location) or a set of circumstances. The reason is that the
   person in the bus is not in a situation with others, to reach any goal. The
   only goal of being in the bus, is to go from point A to B. But the person
   does not need any other person in that bus to reach that goal. The only
   person, that is needed, is the bus driver. With the bus driver the person
   does share a minimal situation. If for example one of the other travelers,
   asks our main character, a question, let's say about the weather, there is
   still no minimal situation: What goal is there to reach for the person asked.
   Not necessarily any goal. One could think of being polite, which relates to
   maintaining social status or gaining it, obtaining a more positive self
   image or even the thought of gaining positive karma. But those are optional
   goals. The person has a choice, because of being doomed to freedom, to not
   see any goal to reach, and therefore leaving the situation of being asked by
   a stranger in the bus, for what it is: Being asked and totally ignoring these
   events. Socially, one might consider this rude, and inappropriate. But those
   are rules in a social context. One must clearly see the freedom to choose
   here: Do I engage or not, do I consider the situation a minimal situation or
   just a situation.

3. Being in public places
   When in a shop, government building, education institute or whatever place
   that can be considered a public place, one is physically in the same place.
   However, every person is reaching their own individual goals. These goals
   might be the same in their nature, but they evolve separately and
   independent of other people in that situation.

4. Being in a meeting
   What is the minimal situation in a meeting? The goal of a meeting is
   dependent on what the goal is of each individual. What is clear, from the
   definition of a meeting, is that participants of that meeting will discuss
   with each other.
   Therefore, the goals might involve to increase skills of persuasion, to
   debate or to agree on a certain subject. The reason to be there might be as
   trivial as to not get in trouble because a person is simply expected to be
   there.
   From the point of view of the participant, the minimal situation is nothing
   but getting together and at the very least witness a discussion and
   optionally partaking in discussions if that aids in reaching the individuals
   goals.

   Ask yourself these questions:
   a. Are you dependent on others?
   b. Are your goals of the meeting a necessary incentive to act in such a way
   to make people act the way you think they need to for you to be able to
   reach your goals?
   c.

## Layer 1: Rules of Engagement

1. Always be aware of what the context is. Why are you there, for what reason,
  what are you getting from it. At work, you are there to do your work to earn
  money. In the supermarket you wish to gather groceries and buy them. On the
  street driving your car, you are traveling from point A to B.
  Have as a starting point, the minimal situation. Let it be a choice to make it
  a minimal social situation, but only if it fits your needs. Otherwise, keep it
  minimal. This starting point, is like an anchor, like your center of gravity
  of your body. It is the starting point for all other rules. You can sink back
  into your center of gravity anytime to gain control again, or gain balance
  after loosing it.

<br />

2. No one has any authority over your thinking:

  - Agree to disagree and decide how to move forward.

  - Don't feel forced to come to an outcome. If you need time, than that is it.

  - It is about facts, not opinions. Facts are true or false. Opinions are a mix
    of choices and emotions. But also much more like culture and background of a
    person.

  - Invite others, and let yourself be invited, to talk about the facts. Find
    the one and only truth regarding facts. Work together to get there. Opinions
    are what they are: A form of taste regarding the truth.

  - People can present a truth, not what you should accept as truth. At work for
    example, it is about what is expected of you regarding your behaviour, not
    your opinion nor your convictions. You also never have any obligation
    regarding sharing your inner thoughts, convictions. Never!

<br />

3. In meetings with people, be aware of the context. Have focus on it, when
  thinking of what to say. Only say or ask things that fit within the context.
  Also, dare to ask for the context. You not knowing what the context is, makes
  it impossible for you to partake in the meeting. If that is the case, why are
  you there?

<br />

4. You can stop before the context switch and indicate not to agree. There
  should be room to disagree and indicate it is still not clear. Time can not be
  a reason to switch anyway. Switching is fine, but with agreement to disagree
  and to continue without an outcome.

<br />

5. You can later request to come back to a subject within the context: No double
  jeopardy. As long as the context is active, whatever is within the context
  can be discussed. Only when you switched context you can no longer revisit a
  subject. Nobody can overrule this.

<br />

6. Everybody in a meeting is responsible to check that everybody had the chance
  to add to the meeting, and agrees to move forward and signs off on it, before
  context switching. Don't you want to hear the opinion of others? Don't you
  want reflection, feedback, criticism regarding what you think is true / the
  truth? If not, why are you in a meeting with them?

<br />

7. Choices made, are always written down, for reference later on. What is
  written down has to be unambiguous. This includes the reasons why not
  unanimous decisions were chosen. Those that did not agree, are they okay with
  proceeding anyway, and why? Make it very clear what was decided. Don't keep it
  in the minds of the participants of the meeting. Instead, write
  down conclusions, arguments and opinions down per subject that was discussed
  within the context.

<br />

8. Use clear language that you know everybody will understand. Language, words,
  the points you try to convey that form your argument for a certain claim.
  Ask for feedback that people listened and understood your point, don't dive
  into a discussion right after, and demand that before any discussion, you have
  been heard, and everybody had the chance to indicate they understood what you
  tried to convey.
  <br /><br />
  Try to get feedback in the form of confirmation that people listened and
  understood what you try to convey. Test there view of it. And don't hesitate
  to spend some time on it. Only after that, move on.
  <br /><br />
  Don't cluster with others when they try to convey their point. Only listen and
  indicate what you think you understood. Don't reward not clarifying a point of
  view or opinion, by immediately jumping into the meeting that you also
  agree, and that should mean something. Take the time to let others
  individually on their own merits make their point clear. Judge the content,
  not the form. The form can be that more than one person thinks the same, but
  this is not an indication a statement is correct or true.

<br />

9. Every person that partakes in a meeting acknowledges these rules of
  engagement, and will check others within the team follow them too. If members
  of the meeting do not follow these rules, every person is responsible to check
  why someone is deviating from these rules, and if that is desirable. People
  that follow different rules then these rules, but with the same goals as these
  rules, are not wrong. But it should be clear within the meeting what rules are
  going to be used.

<br />

10. Benefit of the doubt... álways! Wait with conclusions before you know for
  sure you understand the other person(s). Even then, once you know for sure
  what the other person means, imply the conclusion you think you can then draw,
  as a final check that you understood correct. Focus after this on the content
  of the claim, not what your opinion is regarding someone having a certain
  opinion or thinking a certain claim is true.

There is no social dependence on others. This is a situation that is perceived by participants. For participants in the situation, one might be experiencing a minimal situation, while others a minimal social situation, and maybe a third a full blown social situation where people are socially acquinted with each other. |

## Appendix B: Minimal Situation

The minimal situation is, to start with, a situation.
Minimal refers to the fact that what is added to the situation is only that what
is needed in order for the situation to help reach the goals of its consumers.
A situation is simply a location or a set of circumstances. A minimal situation,
however, is a situation, that someone or something chooses, to use it to reach
certain goals, but that cannot be simplified more, without making it useless to
reach the goals it is intended to be used for. It can be an existing situation
or one that one desires to create.
One should bear in mind, that each individual participant can have its
own definition of what the minimal situation is for that individual. One can
demand to have strict rules relating to how to listen to each other. Others can
demand to have certain rituals in place. But one should always ask themselves
the question: Are the needs of others, really necessary to be catered for, to
reach a minimal situation for them? How much energy should be put in? It is
important to look at the goals, and what factually is the minimal situation in
order for everyone to reach those goals. People might have personal goals, by
using the minimal situation. But in order to have the situation cater for that
need, it needs to be made a little more complex: More is needed to

A concrete example is that
of a meeting. A meeting is a situation that is created and participants choose
to be part of it. The location and the set of circumstances are (carefully) chosen.
The minimal situation then, in the context of a meeting, is one where nothing is
added to it but what is minimally necessary to have that meeting. That can be a
place where one will have that meeting, a medium like software to meet online...
etc. After that, only that what is absolutely necessary to reach the goals is
added. One can imagine that a language is agreed upon to use to communicate.
Furthermore, a set of rules to cleanly communicate, like rules of speaking time,
or a style of communication that dictates a set of rules how to engage with each
other.

## Appendix C: Minimal Social Situation

### Structure of a meeting

It starts with a clear reason to engage with each other in a meeting with
multiple people. To take as a starting point the minimal situation, what is the
least complex situation one can think of, that can still be called a meeting?
First of all, notice that the word 'social' is missing. What is a minimal social
situation compared to a minimal situation? What is a minimal social situation?

#### Minimal situation in a meeting

In this situation the reason for a meeting is purely data exchange. What
else can there be? Talking, having a meeting is by definition a situation in
which data is exchanged using communication. Having that as a starting point
means legitimising what is said. Any communication costs energy. Who pays for
the energy? In a professional context, this is the client. How to legitimise the
money spent that is being spent?

#### Minimal social situation in a meeting




Levels of interaction

We can walk in the same physical space, outside on the street, or inside in a
room, without interacting with each other. Most of the time one will recognise
the implied social obligation to interact within a social context. But if one
just looks at the simple movement, without any other behaviour then moving from
point A to B, there is no communication going on. One could argue that even then
communication is happening, because one has chosen a certain set of clothes.
The style, color, type of clothing is communication. But is it still true if the
intention is not to communicate anything with these clothes? This is the case
when one is traveling to an event, where one does try to communicate with the
persons at the event, by way of these clothes, but not to the people that person
encounters on the way to that particular event.

## Appendix C: Applying these rules in the context of Social Defenses

Humans are social in nature, but at the same time not bound to only acting
socially. There are a lot of emotions hinging on our social functioning and the
perception of our social position in our lives. The context social defenses
relates therefore to defending against toxic situations in the social context.
The question is then: Is every engagement with another person or persons, social
in nature? And if not, how do social defenses relate to them?


## Appendix E: Observed side effects

## Appendix F: Implications of a (mathematical) Model of the Psyche




# Random BS to think about, that could potentially evolve into something useful to someone

Isnt the problem of youth, the inability to gain enough social status with there
inexperience and ignorance, not to be confused with indifference, that one has
to create oneself a social context completely isolated from the one in which it
is impossible to gain any position due to the lack of social status? Does this
also not relate directly, is this not the cause of the behaviour of young people
to keep reinventing what is the new best thing, the new cologne, the clothes,
the new way to look, all in service of gaining social status in a social context,
but moreover defining that social context to begin with. Not only does that protect
the ones with high social status, but even the ones without: At the very least
the non insiders, the participants of the bigger social context, society, can't
affect the low social status holders.

If growing up, "becoming a woman", is about finding out about the social
constructs one is subject to, isn't that merely choosing to be a play ball of
those who rule these social constructs?
Isn't that a limitation in itself to choose merely the set of social constructs
as your playing field? That is if you have a choice, which is of course not
always the case for everyone may it be an illusion or absolute truth in a given
situation. Shouldn't feminism then not first set women free of the burden to
choose between the offered social constructs offered by society? Instead, set
them free by enlightening them that there is a choise, and that one of the
options is to choose not to choose a social construct, but
instead their own identity without any repercussions in the form of "social
punishment"?

Behaviour of an individual is not punishable in the sense of expecting the
result of that punishment to have the effect of making the person conform to the
concept that that behaviour was wrong. It is between that person and its
convictions regarding a moral standard and or an ethics framework whether it was
wrong. People can conform external and internal.
(Relating to system building and to get to a situation that gives the optimal
outcome of controlling human behaviour versus leaving enough freedom to evolve
as a society)
