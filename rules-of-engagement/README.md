# Rules of Engagement Framework

## Introduction

This is a description of the Rules of Engagement Framework. This is a system
that one can use to effectively partake in any meeting or engagement of any kind
with any other person(s) on this planet. If one reads the previous, one must be
immediately triggered by that claim: Any person, and effectively. Most of us
will have had the experience of having to deal with "difficult" or "obtrusive" 
people, that didn't make it possible to have a successful meeting that could be
described as fruitful. However, this framework not only promises to give one the
tools to be effective and successful, but moreover become immune to psychosocial
attacks, exclusion, confusion and frustration and a lot more negative
experiences.

The framework consists of a set of layers. The highest layer is layer 1. The
deeper you go, layer after layer that you descent, the higher the number of the
layer. That is not only convenient for the author to add layers at his disposal
and not having to update all those numbers everytime he does that, but it also
is an indication of the difficulty level of processing and dealing with that
particular layer.
Each layer is an addition to the understanding of what you're dealing with as a
reader: The world of phenomena we call reality. (And yes... read that book
"L'Être et le Néant").

## Minimal Situation

The minimal situation can be described as a situation that cannot be simplified
more. But in addition, it is a situation that serves to reach certain goals for
a person, of which the person is fully aware. If it is not useful for a person
to reach any particular goal, it is simply a situation.

The requirements to call a situation a minimal situation:

1. It is a situation
2. It serves to reach a certain set of goals for a person for whom it is a
   minimal situation.
3. It cannot be simplified further, or be consisting of fewer characteristics, 
   without losing the functionality for the participant to reach a certain set
   of goals.
4. It is a situation with other people, where one is dependent on those people
   in that same situation.

### Examples of the Minimal Situation

1. Sitting in a bus.
   <br />
   This situation is to start with nothing but a situation: A concept relating
   to a position (location) or a set of circumstances. But not necessarily
   a minimal situation if only looking at the location and the people in the bus
   other than the bus driver. The reason is that the
   person in the bus is not in a situation with the other passengers, to reach any goal. The
   only goal of being in the bus, is to go from point A to B. But the person
   does not need any other passenger in that bus to reach that goal. The only
   person, that is needed, is the bus driver. With the bus driver the person
   does share a minimal situation. The person needs the bus driver to drive the
   bus to the destination the person wishes to get to. The bus driver expects
   certain things from the passenger: Obey the house rules, pressing the stop
   button in time and clearly communicate when there is a question for example.
   On the other hand, if one of the other travelers, asks the person, a
   question, let's say about the weather, there is still no minimal situation:
   What goal is there to reach for the person asked. Not necessarily any goal.
   One could think of being polite, which relates to
   maintaining social status or gaining it, obtaining a more positive self-image
   or even the thought of gaining positive karma. But those are optional goals.
   The person has a choice, to not see any
   goal to reach, and therefore leaving the situation of being asked by a
   stranger in the bus, for what it is: Being asked and totally ignoring these
   events. Socially, one might consider this rude, and inappropriate. But those
   are rules in a social context. One must clearly see the freedom to choose
   here: Do I engage or not, do I consider the situation a minimal situation or
   just a situation. The reader will recognise hopefully the freedom that now
   comes to light. The freedom in that one can choose between going from the
   situation one is in, the passenger with fellow passengers in the bus, 


2. Being in public places
   <br />
   When in a shop, government building, education institute or whatever place
   that can be considered a public place, one is physically in the same place.
   However, every person is reaching their own individual goals. These goals
   might be the same in their nature, but they evolve separately and
   independent of other people in that situation.


3. Being in a meeting
   <br />
   What is the minimal situation in a meeting? The goal of a meeting is
   dependent on what the goal is of each individual. What is clear, from the
   definition of a meeting, is that participants of that meeting will discuss
   with each other.
   Therefore, the goals might involve to increase skills of persuasion, to
   debate or to agree on a certain subject. The reason to be there might be as
   trivial as to not get in trouble because a person is simply expected to be
   there.
   From the point of view of the participant, the minimal situation is nothing
   but getting together and at the very least witness a discussion and
   optionally partaking in discussions if that aids in reaching the individuals
   goals.

   Ask yourself these questions:
   a. Are you dependent on others?
   b. Are your goals of the meeting a necessary incentive to act in such a way
   to make people act the way you think they need to for you to be able to
   reach your goals?
   c.

## Layer 1: Rules of Engagement

1. Always be aware of what the context is. Why are you there, for what reason,
  what are you getting from it. At work, you are there to do your work to earn
  money. In the supermarket you wish to gather groceries and buy them. On the
  street driving your car, you are traveling from point A to B.
  Have as a starting point, the minimal situation. Let it be a choice to make it
  a minimal social situation, but only if it fits your needs. Otherwise, keep it
  minimal. This starting point, is like an anchor, like your center of gravity
  of your body. It is the starting point for all other rules. You can sink back
  into your center of gravity anytime to gain control again, or gain balance
  after loosing it.

<br />

2. No one has any authority over your thinking:

  - Agree to disagree and decide how to move forward.

  - Don't feel forced to come to an outcome. If you need time, than that is it.

  - It is about facts, not opinions. Facts are true or false. Opinions are a mix
    of choices and emotions. But also much more like culture and background of a
    person.

  - Invite others, and let yourself be invited, to talk about the facts. Find
    the one and only truth regarding facts. Work together to get there. Opinions
    are what they are: A form of taste regarding the truth.

  - People can present a truth, not what you should accept as truth. At work for
    example, it is about what is expected of you regarding your behaviour, not
    your opinion nor your convictions. You also never have any obligation
    regarding sharing your inner thoughts, convictions. Never!

<br />

3. In meetings with people, be aware of the context. Have focus on it, when
  thinking of what to say. Only say or ask things that fit within the context.
  Also, dare to ask for the context. You not knowing what the context is, makes
  it impossible for you to partake in the meeting. If that is the case, why are
  you there?

<br />

4. You can stop before the context switch and indicate not to agree. There
  should be room to disagree and indicate it is still not clear. Time can not be
  a reason to switch anyway. Switching is fine, but with agreement to disagree
  and to continue without an outcome.

<br />

5. You can later request to come back to a subject within the context: No double
  jeopardy. As long as the context is active, whatever is within the context
  can be discussed. Only when you switched context you can no longer revisit a
  subject. Nobody can overrule this.

<br />

6. Everybody in a meeting is responsible to check that everybody had the chance
  to add to the meeting, and agrees to move forward and signs off on it, before
  context switching. Don't you want to hear the opinion of others? Don't you
  want reflection, feedback, criticism regarding what you think is true / the
  truth? If not, why are you in a meeting with them?

<br />

7. Choices made, are always written down, for reference later on. What is
  written down has to be unambiguous. This includes the reasons why not
  unanimous decisions were chosen. Those that did not agree, are they okay with
  proceeding anyway, and why? Make it very clear what was decided. Don't keep it
  in the minds of the participants of the meeting. Instead, write
  down conclusions, arguments and opinions down per subject that was discussed
  within the context.

<br />

8. Use clear language that you know everybody will understand. Language, words,
  the points you try to convey that form your argument for a certain claim.
  Ask for feedback that people listened and understood your point, don't dive
  into a discussion right after, and demand that before any discussion, you have
  been heard, and everybody had the chance to indicate they understood what you
  tried to convey.
  <br /><br />
  Try to get feedback in the form of confirmation that people listened and
  understood what you try to convey. Test there view of it. And don't hesitate
  to spend some time on it. Only after that, move on.
  <br /><br />
  Don't cluster with others when they try to convey their point. Only listen and
  indicate what you think you understood. Don't reward not clarifying a point of
  view or opinion, by immediately jumping into the meeting that you also
  agree, and that should mean something. Take the time to let others
  individually on their own merits make their point clear. Judge the content,
  not the form. The form can be that more than one person thinks the same, but
  this is not an indication a statement is correct or true.

<br />

9. Every person that partakes in a meeting acknowledges these rules of
  engagement, and will check others within the team follow them too. If members
  of the meeting do not follow these rules, every person is responsible to check
  why someone is deviating from these rules, and if that is desirable. People
  that follow different rules then these rules, but with the same goals as these
  rules, are not wrong. But it should be clear within the meeting what rules are
  going to be used.

<br />

10. Benefit of the doubt... álways! Wait with conclusions before you know for
  sure you understand the other person(s). Even then, once you know for sure
  what the other person means, imply the conclusion you think you can then draw,
  as a final check that you understood correct. Focus after this on the content
  of the claim, not what your opinion is regarding someone having a certain
  opinion or thinking a certain claim is true.

## Appendix B: Minimal Situation

The minimal situation is, to start with, a situation.
Minimal refers to the fact that what is added to the situation is only that what
is needed in order for the situation to help reach the goals of its consumers.
A situation is simply a location or a set of circumstances. A minimal situation,
however, is a situation, that someone or something chooses, to use it to reach
certain goals, but that cannot be simplified more, without making it useless to
reach the goals it is intended to be used for. It can be an existing situation
or one that one desires to create.
One should bear in mind, that each individual participant can have its
own definition of what the minimal situation is for that individual. One can
demand to have strict rules relating to how to listen to each other. Others can
demand to have certain rituals in place. But one should always ask themselves
the question: Are the needs of others, really necessary to be catered for, to
reach a minimal situation for them? How much energy should be put in? It is
important to look at the goals, and what factually is the minimal situation in
order for everyone to reach those goals. People might have personal goals, by
using the minimal situation. But in order to have the situation cater for that
need, it needs to be made a little more complex: More is needed to

A concrete example is that
of a meeting. A meeting is a situation that is created and participants choose
to be part of it. The location and the set of circumstances are (carefully) chosen.
The minimal situation then, in the context of a meeting, is one where nothing is
added to it but what is minimally necessary to have that meeting. That can be a
place where one will have that meeting, a medium like software to meet online...
etc. After that, only that what is absolutely necessary to reach the goals is
added. One can imagine that a language is agreed upon to use to communicate.
Furthermore, a set of rules to cleanly communicate, like rules of speaking time,
or a style of communication that dictates a set of rules how to engage with each
other.

## Appendix C: Minimal Social Situation

### Structure of a meeting

It starts with a clear reason to engage with each other in a meeting with
multiple people. To take as a starting point the minimal situation, what is the
least complex situation one can think of, that can still be called a meeting?
First of all, notice that the word 'social' is missing. What is a minimal social
situation compared to a minimal situation? What is a minimal social situation?

#### Minimal situation in a meeting

In this situation the reason for a meeting is purely data exchange. What
else can there be? Talking, having a meeting is by definition a situation in
which data is exchanged using communication. Having that as a starting point
means legitimising what is said. Any communication costs energy. Who pays for
the energy? In a professional context, this is the client. How to legitimise the
money spent that is being spent?

#### Minimal social situation in a meeting




Levels of interaction

We can walk in the same physical space, outside on the street, or inside in a
room, without interacting with each other. Most of the time one will recognise
the implied social obligation to interact within a social context. But if one
just looks at the simple movement, without any other behaviour then moving from
point A to B, there is no communication going on. One could argue that even then
communication is happening, because one has chosen a certain set of clothes.
The style, color, type of clothing is communication. But is it still true if the
intention is not to communicate anything with these clothes? This is the case
when one is traveling to an event, where one does try to communicate with the
persons at the event, by way of these clothes, but not to the people that person
encounters on the way to that particular event.

## Appendix D: Applying these rules in the context of Social Defenses

Humans are social in nature, but at the same time not bound to only acting
socially. There are a lot of emotions hinging on our social functioning and the
perception of our social position in our lives. The context social defenses
relates therefore to defending against toxic situations in the social context.
The question is then: Is every engagement with another person or persons, social
in nature? And if not, how do social defenses relate to them?


## Appendix E: Observed side effects

## Appendix F: Implications of a (mathematical) Model of the Psyche

## Appendix G: Practical instructions

Do yourself a favour and revisit the Matrix, to then realise it is not a
physical world matrix that is tried to be conveyed, but instead a social Matrix,
that one needs to be Red Pilled from. It is the set of social constructs, one
believes in, to be true, deterministic in nature, and inescapable, that causes
hell. Wasn't it Sartre who said: ["Hell is other people"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit)?

Instead, free yourself by realising, you choose to be with "other people"
in the
same room, where the "room" here is a set of social constructs. Just choose no,
[choose not to choose li...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainspotting_(film))
the social construct: "I'm not part of that other
person's tribe, clan or social group, nor is that other person part of my tribe,
clan or social group." The first resistance comes in the form of your
subconscious, that will immediately check if you are sure, by giving the subtle
counterargument in the form of a rhetorical question: Aren't we (the subconscious
and you, the soul, the awareness, the nothingness), socially dependent on that
other person? (Which is exactly that social matrix one needs to be Red Pilled
from)

No! The starting point is a situation, that can become a minimal situation. From
there a minimal social situation. But to function in society, work, eat, sleep,
be included, one can suffice by choosing nothing but at the most a minimal
situation. Not ever is a minimal social situation desired, nor should one feel
forced to upgrade a minimal situation to a social one: "Why do you act so anti
social", "Why are you ignoring me", "Why are you so rude". Instead: "Im just
here to get my groceries", "Im here to do my job, not to make friends", "You're
the police officer being paid to do your job, I'm not being paid to have a
social conversation with you now, so what do you want otherwise I'm gone."

The inclination of conforming to social rituals and unwritten rules, finds its
roots in the fear of being kicked out of the tribe, clan or social group which
is no longer present. When we were still living in groups of hundreds of people
we needed to survive socially in the group to survive as an individual. You
abide by the rules, or you would get lower status, which would act as a
mechanism to keep track who to keep and who to ditch. But, in modern day
society, we don't survive as a group anymore. We are dealing instead with an
information system. Each and every person has equal base rights, and a number:
The infamous social security number. Roles still exist, and a role can be
privileged, but not the human being fulfilling a role in society.
Your social status does not determine whether you have access to healthcare or
the public library, or education. Although people might form social groups
anyway, and try to convince people that social status is a prerequisite to be
able to use services or utilities offered by society. By way of proxy they are
in between the good intention of social system builders that describe and advise
the use of said services and utilities, and the consumer, the member of society
for which the services and utilities are meant.


# Random BS to think about, that could potentially evolve into something useful to someone

Isnt the problem of youth, the inability to gain enough social status with there
inexperience and ignorance, not to be confused with indifference, that one has
to create oneself a social context completely isolated from the one in which it
is impossible to gain any position due to the lack of social status? Does this
also not relate directly, is this not the cause of the behaviour of young people
to keep reinventing what is the new best thing, the new cologne, the clothes,
the new way to look, all in service of gaining social status in a social context,
but moreover defining that social context to begin with. Not only does that protect
the ones with high social status, but even the ones without: At the very least
the non insiders, the participants of the bigger social context, society, can't
affect the low social status holders.

If growing up, "becoming a woman", is about finding out about the social
constructs one is subject to, isn't that merely choosing to be a play ball of
those who rule these social constructs?
Isn't that a limitation in itself to choose merely the set of social constructs
as your playing field? That is if you have a choice, which is of course not
always the case for everyone may it be an illusion or absolute truth in a given
situation. Shouldn't feminism then not first set women free of the burden to
choose between the offered social constructs offered by society? Instead, set
them free by enlightening them that there is a choise, and that one of the
options is to choose not to choose a social construct, but
instead their own identity without any repercussions in the form of "social
punishment"?

Behaviour of an individual is not punishable in the sense of expecting the
result of that punishment to have the effect of making the person conform to the
concept that that behaviour was wrong. It is between that person and its
convictions regarding a moral standard and or an ethics framework whether it was
wrong. People can conform external and internal.
(Relating to system building and to get to a situation that gives the optimal
outcome of controlling human behaviour versus leaving enough freedom to evolve
as a society)

Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation,
Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

#### 0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

#### 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers
to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,
and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify
or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be
at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

#### 2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

#### 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you
as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the
full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.
You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with
changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of
the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.

#### 4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

-   A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
    distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
    versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
    History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a
    previous version if the original publisher of that version
    gives permission.
-   B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
    entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
    Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
    authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
    fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
-   C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
    Modified Version, as the publisher.
-   D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
-   E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
    adjacent to the other copyright notices.
-   F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
    notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
    under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the
    Addendum below.
-   G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
    Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
    license notice.
-   H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
-   I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
    and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
    authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
    Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
    Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
    publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an
    item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
    previous sentence.
-   J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
    for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
    likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
    versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History"
    section. You may omit a network location for a work that was
    published at least four years before the Document itself, or if
    the original publisher of the version it refers to
    gives permission.
-   K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
    Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
    the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
    and/or dedications given therein.
-   L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
    in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
    equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
-   M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may
    not be included in the Modified Version.
-   N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
    "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
-   O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
partiesâ€”for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

#### 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".

#### 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.

#### 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

#### 8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

#### 9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

#### 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns. See
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies
that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be
used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

#### 11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

### ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

        Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
        Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
        under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
        or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
        with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
        A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
        Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with â€¦ Texts." line with this:

        with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
