__*One for all*__: One organization for any natural person that requires help or
protection. Whether that is from the government, an employer or any threat
perceived.

__*All for one*__: Every natural person supports this idea of a central concept

there, whether that being a concrete organization or not, but at least a
concrete concept, that everyone can draw from. Support that can come in the form
of financial support, moral support, intellectual support, you name it. Carried
by many, protecting the few.
