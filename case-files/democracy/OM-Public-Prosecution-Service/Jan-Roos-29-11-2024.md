# Introduction: Jan Roos' arrest 29th November 2024

Mister Roos got arrested in 2024, the 29th of November, taken from his home
allegedly (research under way what exactly happened) and taken to a police
station. He was later ruled innocent by a judge in the Netherlands. Question:
Why was he taken from his home without question, while he was not a threat to
public safety or any individual, and later clearly declared innocent by a judge.
Where did freedom of speech go?

# Rhetoric

Freedom of speech is one of the most, if not the most, important pillars of
a [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy). When institutions of
powers
in a democracy start misusing given powers, powers given by society itself, the
negative consequences of misuse can lead to limitations of this freedom. Or, in
the worst case, end a democracy.

It is up to society, the collection of natural persons, civilians, to keep
instituations in check. In part, this is accomplished by way of
[Trias Politica](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trias_politica),
where civilians delegate oversight to institutions of the government and
journalists to do the checking. But is it enough?
Who is in the end overseeing the Public Prosecution Service? Isn't that the
combination of the parlement and the judges in the Netherlands looking at:

But the parlement is a representation of the people. The civilians of the
Netherlands. The civilians use the parlement, plus the Public Prosecution
Service in the end as moral systems, to delegate moral responsibility to, but
that also means, that if power is abused by these moral systems, the people have
to take action against this abuse. Of course, if wrong behavior is identified,
it can be incompetence, or intentional bad behavior. Only in the case of
intentional bad behavior we can speak of abuse. But it is the responsibility of
the people to discern which of the two it was, and take action. Take for example
the misuse of power by the police in Eindhoven: Water canon used against one
single civilian, up close and personal. Attempted murder or a mistake of using
this excessive power against an innocent woman, that had severe permanent
damage? 

We have the moral obligation to keep an eye on the natural evolution of systems
that we perceive as statically defined and being static in their nature, while
they are not: In part they are implemented in the form of the training and
experience of the human beings that in part form these systems. What they bring
with them to work, determines in part the functional architecture of the systems
that we, the people, delegate responsibility to. No oversight and measurement of
the effectiveness and negative functionality that emerges from the system once
it is put to work, is allowing it to do harm with said negative side effect of
undesired unexpected emerging functionality.

The oversight of the Public Prosecution Service, comes first in the form of the
judges and second, the politically responsible entity, the
[minister of justice and security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ministers_of_justice_of_the_Netherlands)

If we then look at the allowed interactions with the public to be used,
like arresting people at home and taking them without any pause, we need to look
at the circumstances we allow the Public Prosecution Service to use these
measures and how the service is checked for the intentions behind these severe
intervening measures. They intervene with the normal lifes of civilians. Only,
and absolutely only, when it is in the public interest, may a life be
interrupted by an arrest, if it serves public interest, like protecting people.
What other reason can the Public Prosecution Service have for this harsh
measure? But even if they believe they have a legitimate reason to intervene so
severely, we, the people, have to check. Imagine some middle-aged burnout
individuals proxying their functions and think "I will punish him! Not on my
watch!", then it is our responsibility, we the people, to stop this, get them
fired, and change the system so this does not happen again. What happened in
this case? Do I know as a civilian? Yet, at the same time I'm responsible in
part for the inconvenience and suffering mr Roos endured.

The conclusion is that I, the cake eating "droeftoeter" civilian that I am, will
have to ask for a justification of the actions of the Public Prosecution Service
in the north of the Netherlands, ánd ask the parliament what they are going to
do. Also, the minister of justice and security has to be asked what the policy
is and if the Public Prosecution Service went too far. This all to guarantee the
psychosocial safety of all civilians of the Netherlands. People, civilians, are
loosing faith in the legal system. We had the
[Dutch childcare benefits scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_childcare_benefits_scandal)
that demoralised a lot of people allegedly if it comes to believing in justice
by the legal system. We can't afford more loss of trust in pillars of a
democracy. Then we had the water canon incident and the alleged rapes in female
prisons. When is it enough? Time for action again. (Point here: Were people
prosecuted in time to get justice or at least an explanation of what is done to
prevent this from happening again?)
