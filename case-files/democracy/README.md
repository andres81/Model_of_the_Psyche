# Introduction

# Protests in Dutch universities to stop cooperation with Israeli universities

Protesting is a right, but there are limits. What are they? And to what extent
is "violence" by the police tolerated or plain necessary to keep the peace and
protect other citizens? Is violence against police every legitimate? How does
society protect the safety of police officers, who are at the end of the day
also members of society, natural persons?

What role did journalists play? Do they have a right to target police officers
who were ordered to use force to end the protects that were factually no longer
lawful, peaceful, and legitimate? How is it possible that members of the staff
of the UvA still referred to the protests as "peaceful"? How legitimate is that
in itself?
