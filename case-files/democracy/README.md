Is [Lady Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Justice) always blind? How
does the [Legal System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_system) work and
what are its [purposes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt4d0ZHcMws)?

If rape is punished based on the situation of the rapist, what message does it
send to society? Rape is justified if you promise to give back enough to society
based on the promise of your talents? Is that how justice works? The system to
prevent seeking private justice? Revenge? How about the duty of care of society
by using the moral system that the legal system is? Doesn't the legal system
in part prevent undesired behavior by communicating the consequences of said
behavior in the form of

# Protests at Dutch universities to stop coöperation with Israeli universities

Protesting is a right, but there are limits. What are they? And to what extent
is "violence" by the police tolerated or plain necessary to keep the peace and
protect other citizens? Is violence against police every legitimate? How does
society protect the safety of police officers, who are at the end of the day
also members of society, natural persons?

What role did journalists play? Do they have a right to target police officers
who were ordered to use force to end the protects that were factually no longer
lawful, peaceful, and legitimate? How is it possible that members of the staff
of the UvA still referred to the protests as "peaceful"? How legitimate is that
in itself?

# The necessity for the understanding of democracy and civil duty

__*"Discrimination against certain (social) groups in society (men,
religious/ethnic/cultural groups, women), is allowed when it is done in order to
push an ideological agenda that supports or acts as a precursor of the
ideological agenda of equal rights and (social) inclusivity in society."*__

The above is an example of a potentially very dangerous conviction, although
maybe potentially, to groups of people, tempting to busy as a foundation of a
view of society and set of engagement strategies towards society. But it ignores
the working and agreements made in a democracy to make said system work. If the
responsibility of protecting civilians for example is projected onto a (social)
subgroup in society, the institutions that are in place in a democracy are
skipped, with all kinds of consequences. Especially with the
[Rule of Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law)
in
place. Where the justice system acts as a deterrent against harmful behavior.
This system failing to protect, should indicate to civilians, that the way the
justice system works as a deterrent, does not work against certain individuals,
like for example people with a different ideology than those that support
democracy and the Rule of Law being in place:

__*"I have a right to look down on
women and harm them! That is my ideology and I will enforce it on everyone, or I
will use violence!"*__.

The justice system acting proactively preventively only works against harmful
behavior by individuals that are competent and willing to partake in society
that employs the rule of law. Incompetency will result in the justice system
protecting society reactively by applying
[Terbeschikkingstelling (Nederlands strafrecht)](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terbeschikkingstelling_(Nederlands_strafrecht)).

With the growing group of
[Asylum seekers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker) however
the group that not necessarily believes in the same ideologies grows. The
ideologies that form the basis of a healthy democracy and help the rule of law
be applied and make it work as a proactively preventive measure against harmful
behavior. If one then starts arguing:

__*"The perceived lack of safety, is merely
because a subgroup in society didn't do their job! And on top of that, they are
to blame for this harmful behavior in the first place! Attack them with guilt
blaming and other psychological warfare techniques! Then I at least feel good
again, and that is important now..."*__

people forget that society might be in need of a more effective approach, namely
developing a new moral system in addition to the justice system: A system that
prevents non-complying human beings to partake in society to begin with. Like
earning a driver's license, you are taken from the equation until you proof
proactively, not reactively, that you will behave according to the agreements
made and we have in society. But does that not already exist? Don't I need a
visa if I wish to visit the USA for example? Or other civilians to visit The
Netherlands?

__*Women are not alone responsible for the safety of women!*__

Exactly! Very good! We, as citizens of The Netherlands or any other democracy,
are áll responsible for the safety and wellbeing of everybody in our society.
That means all women together with áll other civilians together are responsible.
[Not only women are a target, also men, homosexuals, random human beings on the
streets at night.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZybcsyiKGw)
And by using moral systems we delegate in part the responsibility of protection
to, we are effective at protecting. We do this without:

* (social) exclusion
* _"[In colloquial usage, the term demonization is used metaphorically to refer to
  propaganda or moral panic directed against any individual or group, for the
  purpose of defamation, character assassination and/or dehumanization.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonization#Modern_usage)"_
* Earning social credit in the context of (a) perceived social group(s) with the
  possible goala of earning social credit and/or financial profit.
