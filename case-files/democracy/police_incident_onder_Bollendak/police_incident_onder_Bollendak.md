# Utrecht police officer action against two women

## Problem description

In short, a police officer arrested one woman, and shortly after he kicked, and
started using his weapon stick. The
question now is, was this violence justified according to the rules of
engagement agreed with the police force, but
moreover, does society accept this behavior like was visible in the videos that
were made or not. Irrespective of
whether the law permits it, or some committee unknown to the public, what do we
the people want? But
also, where were the parties involved explaining the process? Was everyone
involved communicating democracy
sufficiently? Were enough interventions done to prevent civil unrest? Are the
threats made to the police officer already
signs of civil unrest? Did the mayor of Utrecht do enough proactively? That all
needs to be discussed and researched,
and if necessary letters need to be sent asking for justifications of actions or
the lack thereof.

## Starting point: The rules of engagement in a democracy

Was the police violence justified? Did the police officer proxy his function and
punish the lady or was the violence used to control the situation? Where are the
questions and answers regarding these aspects of situations in which the police
acts?

The police does not have the right to punish people, but instead only the right
to control situations and bring citizens in front of a judge if an
[Officier van Justitie](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officier_van_justitie)
orders so. A judge will judge if you broke the law, and subsequently what the
punishment will be.

If this is not properly communicated by the system responsible to do oversight
of police actions, then civil unrest might occur as a consequence. Don't moral
systems like the police force of the Netherlands have a moral and systemic,
societal obligation to always, with every act, think about the degree of civil
unrest this might cause? Moreover, a duty to act opposite of causing civil
unrest and frustration? The police force is an element of the government and
therefore a representation. Any element of the government, so in essence the
government itself, should act in a manner that prevents civil unrest, not
provoke or feed the process that leads to it. To make it concrete, looking at
the causes given on Wikipedia of civil unrest:

[Mostly civil disorder arises from political grievances (such as opposition to an oppressive or authoritarian state), feeling of victimization due to economic inequality, or other forms of social discord.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disorder#:~:text=Mostly%20civil%20disorder%20arises%20from%20political%20grievances%20(such%20as%20opposition%20to%20an%20oppressive%20or%20authoritarian%20state)%2C%20feeling%20of%20victimization%20due%20to%20economic%20inequality%2C%20or%20other%20forms%20of%20social%20discord.)

If we look at another system, for the sake of using metaphors, like the
workplace and the obligation of employers to lower the psychosocial pressure,
doesn't every organization, especially government organizations, in the
communication and interaction in general with citizens, have the moral
obligation to lower the psychosocial pressure instead of increasing it for
potentially political ideological reasons? Wouldn't that be acts of violations
of human rights? If that would be the case, then that would mean a necessary
escalation to the
[European Court of Human Rights](https://www.echr.coe.int/).

## Analysis

### Dissecting the situation of the police violence

Different descriptions exist already online of the incident. Videos are also
available. It is important to remain factual and to the point without judging.
Nor communicate judgment in the description of the situation when trying to come
to the
right and proper conclusions of what actually happened.

### Description of the police chief Yvonne Hondema

Police chief Yvonne Hondema is in charge of the police unit:
[Regionale Eenheid Midden-Nederland](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regionale_Eenheid_Midden-Nederland).

Her [description of events](https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2026/februari/6/03-politiechef-over-impact-incident-onder-bollendak-en-nasleep.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDe%20collega%20gaat,en%20complexe%20omstandigheden.%E2%80%9D):

_“De collega gaat af op een melding van onrust op Hoog Catharijne. Ter plaatse
ziet hij dat twee vrouwen een andere vrouw onheus bejegenen. Hij spreekt hen
daarop aan, wordt vervolgens uitgescholden en beledigd en houdt één van de twee
vrouwen aan. Dat gaat gepaard met geweld. Deze politieman moet handelen; hij kan
niet wegkijken. Dat is wat ik van hem vraag. Daarbij mag hij, als dat nodig is,
geweld gebruiken._

_Politiewerk is in eerste instantie MENSENwerk. Als ik met mijn professionele
politieblik kijk naar de beelden dan zie ik dat een groot deel van het ingezette
geweld goed politieoptreden, binnen de kaders, ook al kan dat er heftig uitzien.
En voor een deel van het toegepaste geweld geldt dat niet, daar leren we van.
Tegelijkertijd weet ik dat politiewerk vraagt om snelle beslissingen in soms
ingewikkelde en complexe
omstandigheden.”_

### First paragraph analysis

The statements understood by the author of this piece, are the following:

* The police officer responds to an incident, arrives on scene, talks to the two
  women, and sees enough reason to arrest one of the women.
* The arrest is done with the use of violence. The police officer needs to act,
  he cannot look away. That is what police chief Yvonne Hondema expects of
  him. He is allowed to use violence if necessary.

#### First point

It is perfectly okay, according to all the agreements within society, that an
officer of the law, puts someone under arrest. If it was unlawful, one can hire
an attorney and sue. This is all well arranged in society by law.

#### Second point

Although the general instruction is for a police officer to act, this situation
is not just about putting a civilian under arrest, but also about the used
amount of force. The question here is, did the police chief address the need of
the public for clarity here. Was enough empathy from the government shown or
not.

First of all, the arrest itself. How is an arrest normally done within the
Netherlands? Aren't we used to a calm approach by police officers? Is that also
not what we expect? The police officer indicates a person is under arrest, if
outmanned, asks for backup, and waits for backup to arrive. Don't escalate the
situation by trying to physically control a subject when you are not in control
of the situation. But did that actually happen? Before backup arrives, the
police officer has a weapon stick out, and walks away. But to where? To the
police station? Shortly after backup dóes arrive. Okay... Why did the police
officer walk and pulls on the woman? This is not what we civilians are used to
from police officers that arrest someone. It comes across to the author of this
piece
as a very aggressive form of arrest. Also, if this is not the normal way of
arresting civilians, what is the reason to do it different in this situation?
Racism? Bad mood? Shouldn't police officers prevent any misjudgement, by not
creating ambiguous situations? Aren't they trained to prevent this explicitly in
the form of using certain protocols when arresting civilians? Knowing all this
as a civilian, that police officers áre trained like this, why did this police
officer deviate from this? Why was this not addressed in the explanation of
police chief Yvonne Hondema?

The use of the weapon stick. The weapon stick is used to control the situation.
The police is authorized to use the weapon stick, but only if absolutely
necessary. But was the stick necessary? Was the police officer in danger? And
was the stick allowed according to the rules of engagement? On top of that, the
[police website](https://www.politie.nl/informatie/wanneer-mag-de-politie-geweld-gebruiken.html)
indicates that the stick is only allowed when used to hit the arms and legs. But
isn't it shown in the video that the officer hits from up, downward onto the
lady? For what? This might be interpreted as an expression of frustration that
he looses control over the situation. Also, that he chooses that she will be
punished for this. Frustration that leads to aggression with the weapon stick,
but that would be a clear form of proxying the function to give political
substance to the execution of the tasks belonging to the role the individual is
fulfilling at that moment. Because the police officer is only tasked at that
moment with arresting the woman, not executing punishment, that is up to a
judge. And how an arrest is done is agreed upon with society, and checked by the
citizens of the Netherlands.

But was this situation as described above, addressed as it is? Did the police
chief address the procedure to test if the violence used, was allowed? She
instead only indicates that he did what she expects of him as a police chief.
But what does she refer to then? Did he do what the chief expects of him when he
puts her under arrest? Or does she mean the arrest was done right with the
appropriate amount of violence?

She indicates that a portion of the violence is not according to the agreed
rules of engagement. And that "we" meaning "they", the police force, will learn
from this. But what does that even mean? What it means is that the police chief
indicates here, that people make mistakes, and that the police force, the
organization, the system that it is, will learn from this. Which implies
potentially, the training of police officers if it comes to judging a situation,
but also how to apply what violence to the situation. But that
implies silently, and implicitly, that she believes, he did not intentionally
do something bad. No case of acting in bad faith, but mere potential
incompetence at the level of the officer or training he received, so at the
police organizational level. However, that is dangerous because that can be
perceived as gaslighting civilians. Their rage stemming from seeing potential
acting with a racist motive or just anger in general against civilians. This,
because of for example potential rapes in female prisons, "toeslagen affaire",
politicians lying to society... etc. This can lead to perceived oppression and
then lead to civil unrest that can express itself in threatening the police
officer and his family. Civilians seeking for justice themselves because they
see the authorities failing in giving that to them. But that would mean the
police is in part themselves responsible for the threats received by the police
officer.

### Conclusion

__*!!! BIG WORK IN PROGRESS SECTION !!!*__

@TODO: Journalists <br />
@TODO: Utrecht municipality if it comes to manage emotional dynamics of the
public <br />
@TODO: Utrecht municipality and journalists (RTL nieuws / NOS / NU / Telegraaf (
John van den Heuvel door de bocht...)) not explaining the procedures of
oversight, justice, enough! The whole justice / legal system is their also to
prevent people from taking justice into their own hands... wtf are we doing in
this country!<br />
@TODO: Zembla addressed improper use of police violence and the lack of
oversight when it comes to the use of police dogs and the destruction of human
bodies of civilians.
@TODO: Hooligan abuse with excessive force by police again in Utrecht and the
lack of response from the municipality of Utrecht... Sigh

It only puts oil on the fire when a police chief instead of empathizing in the
form of understanding the potential emotional sensation of feeling powerless
against a tyrannical force, the police force, plainly states that she can
understand that the violence used can in itself look intimidating. As if we are
listening to a surgeon breaking open the chest to get to the heart, a situation
in which it is completely expected that that force is necessary and justified,
but moreover, citizens understand why this "violence" is used. It is
different in the case of police officers using force, that in itself seems out
of place. It is then not about the violence in itself being intimidating, the
fact it seems out of place is the reason it comes across intimidating: "Will
this happen to me? When? Are we still safe from the police?". The empathy to
understand thát unrest in society and thát cause for an emotional reaction to
the video spread online is necessary from a police chief, from the mayor of
Utrecht, and all parties involved including and maybe foremost the +1 in
["trias politica +1"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers), the
media/journalists of this country. Where were they explaining what the processes
are that are now taking place and what the follow-up will be.

This is not how human beings operate. This is therefore literally not how it
works. Human beings have an amygdala that can become activated, which in this
case might have happened looking at the threats expressed towards the police
officer in question. Not understanding this is a sign of gross incompetence if
it comes to understanding the human condition, societal processes and the
dynamics of a democracy.
