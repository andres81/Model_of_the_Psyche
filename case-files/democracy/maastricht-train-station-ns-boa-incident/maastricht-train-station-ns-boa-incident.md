13 February 2026, The Netherlands



NS, Regionale Eenheid Limburg, Gemeente Maastricht and Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport,

I write you to report an incident and further measures I am taking. My name is André Schepers and I represent the highest authority in the democracy of the Netherlands: The Institute Citizenship. You represent moral systems that I delegate my moral obligations to until I can no longer do that.

I wish to report to you the incident that happened the evening of the 13th of February 2026 at around 19:30 at the train station of Maastricht.

A young couple walked on the platform to the back to get to the intercity train of the NS. However, the train set was in the back, and they came to the middle/end of the platform too late. They walked a bit further, stayed there and then walked back. At the same time they were at the middle end of the platform, three plus one NS BOA’s walked to the back. At this moment in time, I had not seen any thing wrong looking at their behaviour. No crime was committed. It was clear looking at the way the BOA’s walked, that they were going to intervene. But for what? When they met, on the platform, one of the BOA’s swayed to the right, two remained left. This was a manoeuvre of inclusion/enclose of the young couple. It seemed the gentleman argued a bit with one of the BOA’s and the BOA seemed to talk to him authoritatively. The situation seemed to appear as that the BOA’s had robbed the young couple of their freedom. After the BOA’s had walked away, the young gentleman seemed to comfort his partner who seeemed a bit distressed.
Was this allowed? Why was this done? No crime was committed or was there? If you desire to inform the couple of remaining safe as BOA’s, is this the way to do it? It seemed as an act of unnecessary intimidation. We are the authority and we control you. Either a crime was committed and an official warning was given, didn’t appear like that to me, or you wished to inform them of your concern. In the latter case, you misbehaved! You unnecessarily intimidated them and robbed them of their freedom. That is a crime in my opinion.

In general, what are the limits of interaction with civilians (citizens and tourists etc)? Unlawful interaction and interventions are not only undesirable but also potentially violations of human rights or acts of undermining democracy.

My letter serves two purposes:

    • Demand an explanation of the actions having taken place
    • Inform you of further actions

I wish to ask you for a full explanation of the actions having taken place and for a justification for the way actions were undertaken.

Second, I wish to inform you that in the future, I will after witnessing a situation like the one described above, ask the civilians for a depiction of events to do my civil duty. I might then do an intervention if necessary: Call the police if I deem necessary to check for violations of the law and/or for mediation. In the worst case BOA’s will be put under civil arrest to wait after that for the police.

If in my opinion human rights were violated, oppression, cognitive reprogramming, expressions of ego problems, implying physical abuse or taking away ones freedom, I can in the worst case scenario escalate to The Netherlands. If The Netherlands ignores me, I will escalate to the European Court of Human Rights. With “The Netherlands” I refer to the highest authority the institute citizenship. Meaning I will drag the citizens of The Netherlands in front of the European Court of Human Rights. Looking at the Dutch childcare benefits scandal where Europe intervened and indicated this went too far, after the citizens of The Netherlands were too passive in my opinion, I conclude the citizens of The Netherlands need a kick in the proverbial bottom!

In conclusion, I am a guard dog of the democracy in The Netherlands and in the world. I will fight against violations of human rights and acts of undermining our democracy. I will protect people and our democracy with my life. I see that as my civil duty and moral obligation. I don’t quit, I don’t break, I fight to protect.

I believe by talking and listening we can evolve ideas to make it easier for the guys that come after us: The next generations. Let’s work together, not against each other becoming undesirable thermodynamic processes in society.
The parties addressed in this letter, are in my opinion the moral systems responsible for the situation that is a train station. Therefore I address your responsibilities as representatives of desired moral systems in society. In the end the citizens of The Netherlands are responsible if moral systems fail that we delegate our responsibilities to. I will not serve systems blindly, or just do my duty, but instead use moral systems that serve the need of delegating responsibility to, but that I am therefore also responsible for.

I can of course misunderstand things, or be misinformed, but even if I make mistakes, at least I make mistakes.



You have been informed.

P.P.S

NS, you failed to listen to me. I called you and it was indicated that nothing would be done with my complaint. I was referred to the page of the NS website: “Politie gegevens”. There you inform me and others that you abide by the law. The thing about complaining is… that you are not potentially! You ignoring me, and simply referring me to that website, is in my opinion, to put it lightly, gaslighting me and stonewalling me. Therefore escalations in the form of these letters and others.
Another action I’m undertaking is an escalation regarding the BNN/Vara broadcast regarding the Breda incident and your conversation with Tim Hofman. This is coming! You ignored Tim Hofman and I will not accept that. You ignored with that action the public, the highest authority the Institute Citizenship. You ignored me and my fellow citizens of The Netherlands.



P.P.P.S.

The NS and Prorail have their domain in The Netherlands. But you abide by the rules of society. Dictated and maintained by the highest authority the Institute Citizenship. We oversee the “House rules” and “Code of Conducts” you construct. Also, the degrees of freedom you give to enforcers of rules like police officers and BOA’s. If you violate human rights, interventions will be done.  That’s how simple as it works according to the definition of democracy.
In the end you are merely moral systems, we the people, delegate our moral obligations to, until we can no longer do, because for example you as a representation of a moral system fail to be such a representation.
