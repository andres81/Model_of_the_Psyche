# Proposal Architecture Moral System BOA

The BOA is a concept, a moral system, society wishes to delegate the
responsibility to of security in the public domain. This alleviates the Dutch
police force of its duties, plus, security is present before something happens,
instead of having to arrive on scene (if at all...) like the police after having
been called for.

However, the question arises, due to the fact that this is a fairly new moral
system in use in society, whether the BOA professionals received enough
training. On top of that: Who is responsible for them? Who protects them and who
oversees their behavior?

## Development domains

There are four development domains that a BOA needs to develop:

* The knowledge domain: The theory belonging to the profession. The theory
  behind the techniques used like overpowering a person, giving a fine, the law.
* The skills belonging to the profession should be mastered. This is also
  acquiring knowledge: Tacit knowledge.
* Developing situational awareness. Recognizing patterns in situations that
  might indicate a thread or illegal behavior.
* Mastering the skill to choose the appropriate technique in the right
  situation: Using physical force or talking someone to calm down for example.

## Abuse of power in the domains: Acting in bad faith

## Forms of incompetent behavior and the negative consequences

## Moral duty of society towards BOA professionals: They don't stand alone!
