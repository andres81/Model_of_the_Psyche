# Stop Femicide Now!

Enough is enough! Dutch society, you are receiving a deadline now. The last
chance I offer you now, is the opportunity to help build an organization for the
protection of natural persons. I myself have been subject to abuse and terror in
my life that is absolutely unacceptable. Witnesses of me being bullied and
abused, being a witness, were subject to psychological and emotional damage
subsequently. Where was my protection? It shows again that the moral systems
like police and the legalsystem, and even society itself, or not protecting
to the point I as a citizen feel I have done morally everything possible to
prevent violations of human rights in western society.
