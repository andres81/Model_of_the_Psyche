# Stop Femicide Now!

Enough is enough! Dutch society, you are receiving a deadline now. The last
chance I offer you now is the opportunity to help build an organization for the
protection of natural persons. If not, disrespecting the deadline or not making
it, will force me to go to the
[European Court of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights).
I myself have been subject to abuse and terror in my life that is absolutely
unacceptable. At work being fat shamed, targeted with passive-aggressive
behavior and innuendo, being burglarized and what not. Witnesses of me being
bullied and abused, because of being a witness, were subject to psychological
and emotional damage subsequently. Where was my protection? It shows again that
the moral systems like police and the legalsystem, and even society itself, or
not protecting to the point I as a citizen feel I have done morally everything
possible to prevent violations of human rights in western society. The police
force, the legal system, the government are all
[moral systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism)#Freedom_and_morality),
for
([cake eating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Marcinko)) civilians, that
we can delegate the responsibility of protecting members of society to. But only
to a certain degree, as Sartre clearly explains:

```text
Fundamentally, Sartre believed humankind cannot escape responsibility by
adopting an external moral system, as the adoption of such is in itself a choice
that we endorse – implicitly or explicitly – for which we must take full
responsibility.[13] He argues that one cannot escape this responsibility, as
each attempt to part one's self from the freedom of choice is in itself a
demonstration of choice and choice is dependent on a person's wills and desires.
He states, "I am responsible for my very desire of fleeing responsibilities."
```

Seeing
the [Dutch police fail](https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/binnenland/artikel/5492182/weiteveen-dubbele-moord-politieoptreden-richard-k-ineke-mussche)
when it comes to protecting civilians, until it is too late, and on top that,
the example of:

[Of vrouwen die paniekerig hun verhaal deelden bij de politie, maar waarbij hun angst werd gezien als ‘paranoia’.](https://www.linda.nl/persoonlijk/relaties/femicide-rode-vlaggen/)

Translation:

[Or women who panicked and shared their stories with the police, but their fear was seen as 'paranoia'](https://translate.google.com/?sl=nl&tl=en&text=Of%20vrouwen%20die%20paniekerig%20hun%20verhaal%20deelden%20bij%20de%20politie%2C%20maar%20waarbij%20hun%20angst%20werd%20gezien%20als%20%E2%80%98paranoia%E2%80%99&op=translate)

combining that with the legal system loosing trust, after a
[Dutch childcare benefits scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_childcare_benefits_scandal)
and the
[Eindhoven water canon incident](https://andreschepers.nl/#water-cannon-incident)
it is time to take measures.

Taking measures consists of two parts:

* The attempts at preventing women getting in the situation that femicide might
  occur.
* Dealing with the situations in which femicide potentially occur.

This piece of writing will be concerned with offering potential solutions and
actions the author deems necessary to start ending femicide in at least The
Netherlands.
Furthermore it will explain to what extend the author holds Dutch citizens
accountable for the situation we have ended up in: Femicide happens far too
often while experts claim there are explicit signs before femicide that should
make it far more easier to prevent femicide than the statistics currently show
us.

## Preventing women getting in the situation of potential femicide

## Helping women in situations of potential femicide

## Accountability of Dutch Citizens regarding Femicide

How long has it not been known that Femicide is a real problem? Women in danger
and being murdered, abused, warning society they are in danger and in major
pain. What were the steps taken? What did Dutch citizens do? What should they
have done?

It seems Dutch citizens have been hiding behind ignorance, in essence, according
to the author of this piece: Being indifferent towards their own potentially
known ignorance. Acting in
[bad faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism))?
It becomes worse if you work in a field in which you are forced to become
knowledgeable about the subject:

* Being a judge
* Police officer
* Politician
* Scientist
* Health care professional (social work etc...)

I haven't seen any society disrupting protests at the
[Malieveld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malieveld). Why so silent?
As a natural person, with your nose being pushed hard on the facts, don't you
face the problem of starting to feel the need to
