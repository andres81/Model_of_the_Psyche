# Stop Femicide Now!

Enough is enough! Dutch society, you are receiving a deadline now. The last
chance I offer you now is the opportunity to help build an organization for the
protection of natural persons. If not, disrespecting the deadline or not making
it, will force me to go to the
[European Court of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights).
I myself have been subject to abuse and terror in my life that is absolutely
unacceptable. At work being fat shamed, targeted with passive-aggressive
behavior and innuendo, being burglarized and what not. Witnesses of me being
bullied and abused, because of being a witness, were subject to psychological
and emotional damage subsequently. Where was my protection? It shows again that
the moral systems like police and the legalsystem, and even society itself, or
not protecting to the point I as a citizen feel I have done morally everything
possible to prevent violations of human rights in western society. The police
force, the legal system, the government are all
[moral systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism)#Freedom_and_morality),
for
([cake eating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Marcinko)) civilians, that
we can delegate the responsibility of protecting members of society to. But only
to a certain degree, as Sartre clearly explains:

```text
Fundamentally, Sartre believed humankind cannot escape responsibility by
adopting an external moral system, as the adoption of such is in itself a choice
that we endorse – implicitly or explicitly – for which we must take full
responsibility. He argues that one cannot escape this responsibility, as
each attempt to part one's self from the freedom of choice is in itself a
demonstration of choice and choice is dependent on a person's wills and desires.
He states, "I am responsible for my very desire of fleeing responsibilities."
```

Seeing
the [Dutch police fail](https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/binnenland/artikel/5492182/weiteveen-dubbele-moord-politieoptreden-richard-k-ineke-mussche)
when it comes to protecting civilians, until it is too late, and on top of that,
the example of:

[Of vrouwen die paniekerig hun verhaal deelden bij de politie, maar waarbij hun angst werd gezien als ‘paranoia’.](https://www.linda.nl/persoonlijk/relaties/femicide-rode-vlaggen/)

Translation:

[Or women who panicked and shared their stories with the police, but their fear was seen as 'paranoia'](https://translate.google.com/?sl=nl&tl=en&text=Of%20vrouwen%20die%20paniekerig%20hun%20verhaal%20deelden%20bij%20de%20politie%2C%20maar%20waarbij%20hun%20angst%20werd%20gezien%20als%20%E2%80%98paranoia%E2%80%99&op=translate)

combining that with the legal system loosing trust, after a
[Dutch childcare benefits scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_childcare_benefits_scandal)
and the
[Eindhoven water canon incident](https://andreschepers.nl/#water-cannon-incident)
it is time to take measures.

Taking measures consists of two parts:

* The attempts at preventing women getting in the situation that femicide might
  occur.
* Dealing with the situations in which femicide potentially occurs.

This piece of writing will be concerned with offering potential solutions and
actions the author deems necessary to start ending femicide in at least The
Netherlands.
Furthermore, it will explain to what extent the author holds Dutch citizens
accountable for the situation we have ended up in: Femicide happens far too
often while experts claim there are explicit signs before femicide that should
make it far easier to prevent femicide than the statistics currently show
us.

## Accountability of Dutch Citizens regarding Femicide

How long has it not been known that Femicide is a real problem? Women in danger
and being murdered, abused, warning society they are in danger and in major
pain. What were the steps taken? What did Dutch citizens do? What should they
have done?

It seems Dutch citizens have been hiding behind ignorance, in essence, according
to the author of this piece: Being indifferent towards their own potentially
known ignorance. Acting in
[bad faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism))?
It becomes worse if you work in a field in which you are forced to become
knowledgeable about the subject:

* Being a judge
* Police officer
* Politician
* Scientist
* Health care professional (social work etc...)

I haven't seen any society disrupting protests at the
[Malieveld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malieveld). Why so silent?
As a natural person, with your nose being pushed hard on the facts, don't you
face the problem of starting to feel the need to ask for moral systems you can
delegate your responsibility to, regarding acting against femicide? When does it
become too much before you start acting? Does acting against femicide not first
of all come in the form of helping to evolve ideas? For example, the justice
system has several roles:

* Act as a system that fires warning
  [shots across the bow](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shot_across_the_bow).
* Taking people out of society to prevent further damage:
    * [prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison)
    * [TBS](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terbeschikkingstelling_(Nederlands_strafrecht))
* Prevent civilians from taking justice into their own hands (potential threat
  of
  [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war))

### Civilians believing they are victims of their situation

Civilians finding themselves in the situation of being a civilian in a society
in which femicide happens, might choose to regard themselves as a victim. Or as
Sartre
[describes it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism)#Freedom_and_choice):

```text
Although external circumstances may limit individuals, called facticity, they
cannot force a person to follow one of the remaining courses over another. In
this sense, the individual still has some freedom of choice. For this reason, an
individual may choose in anguish, fully aware that this will have consequences.
For Jean-Paul Sartre, to claim that one amongst many conscious possibilities
takes undeniable precedence (for instance, "I cannot risk my life, because I
must support my family") is to assume the role of an object in the world, not a
free agent, but merely at the mercy of circumstance (a being-in-itself that is
only its own facticity, i.e., it "is" inside itself, and acts there as a
limitation). For Sartre, this attitude is manifestly self-deceiving.
```

But the situation is that as a civilian of a democratic society as The
Netherlands, you have a choice and are in control: Together with all civilians,
you decide what laws govern the country and behavior of persons in the country.
Laws can take people off of the streets. People enter the situation that is
public
space the moment they step out of their homes, or start engaging with society.
And an example of engaging with society and thus stepping in public space, is
when
someone sends a text message to someone else. Or posts on social media, which,
as the UK showed, is policeable.

But exploring the choice of victimhood for citizens, where being a victim means
you are
with your back against the wall, and cannot do anything. We can, first, take a
look at the actual options every citizen has to take moral responsibility for
the freedom one has.

In general, if a citizen sees problems in society, that the current moral
systems don't take care of to the extent that the responsibility does not come
back to the individual, what should a citizen do, or can do? Let's explore some
options:

* Talk to politicians?
* Ask science: Universities, research groups, experts in the field?
* Ask journalists and/or read their contributions, watch documentaries, if not
  present, go to journalists and ask them for action to be taken?
* Think tanks to help evolve ideas that can become solutions to the problem
  under investigation?

In addition, what tool to be used by any civilian, to keep track of all cases
that research and track societal problems currently relevant? The ideas proposed
and researched? A dashboard of society, that is now maybe in the insufficient
form of news platforms and newspapers?

The wining and complaining of Dutch citizens that can be witnessed now seems to
display the conviction of said people, that they do not perceive the civil
duties of participating in
a [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy): Helping evolve the ideas
that are the precursor to changes in the legal system or the extension of
existing laws to evolve with the ever-changing environment in which the
democracy exists.

### Definition of freedom in a democracy

Looking at what a legal system does: Laws that govern what one may and may not
do, one can argue, that the legal system might be upgraded to the point that
women are protected more. Within the current context of this writing, to what
extent did civilians take responsibility regarding the options, a legal system
offers to limit the freedom of women killers and abusers? Abuse in the form of:

* Demanding sex
* Making a partner sleep on the floor as punishment
* Beating women
* Stalking and doxing
* More?

This discussion is not regarding what exactly can be done legally, or
what can be made punishable by law, but moreover, how much did the civilians
that are experts regarding the legal system and legal systems in general do? And
what about non-experts? What did normal civilians do to find out what the legal
system can offer, and what politicians are doing? How important is the subject
femicide for the coming elections in The Netherlands? Did it even cross the
minds of Dutch people? Or is the subject merely a convenient tool during coffee
discussions to profile oneself as a good citizen, a
["moral person"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_and_Nothingness); that
should be regarded as high in social status?

__*You figure it out for yourself!*__

### Conclusion

The conclusion is, that any civilian right now, can be asked a few questions:

* What did you do up until now against femicide?
* What are you planning to do next?
* Do you understand your civil duties as a participant in a democracy to the
  point that you believe that if anyone scrutinizes your actions, they believe
  you acted not in bad faith? In other words: Can you legitimize your actions,
  or can you be considered a mere consumer of society? (Reminding the author of
  the ending
  of [Ergens in de verte](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youp_van_%27t_Hek): "Het
  plafond is zwak...", "Let us dance!", the man that predicted
  the [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis)
  with "Man vermist")

#### Dashboard of Society

Furthermore, a dashboard of society, showing the relevant cases. Describing what
is going on in society at this moment in time, like problems that need to be
solved, and threats posing society. In addition, the ideas that need evolving
regarding insight into the cases. Ideas that might also act eventually as
solutions to problems. That dashboard in itself might be regarded as a moral
system that citizens might regard as necessary to be able to take responsibility
regarding the upkeep of society.

The dashboard of society then fulfills the following functions:

* Overview of the current problems that need urgent attention
* Ideas that need to evolve, that might be a solution for the mentioned problems
  in society
* Overview of involvement of science, politics and all other pillars of society
* Educating people regarding the problems themselves, but moreover about the
  solutions that are not used and why not: Understanding for the time it takes
  before problems are resolved. In order for people to know that it is not
  indifference, but due to a slow process that evolving an idea is, that just
  needs time, like a wine that takes time to become good.

The dashboard, as informative and educational it then is, better at these jobs
than journalism, acts as a social psychologist acts when tasked to fight racism
and/or discrimination in organizations:

* Change
  [psychological schemas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)).
* Change
  [psychological attitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)),
  of which schemas form the foundation.

This dashboard then can also help prevent civilians loosing trust in democrazy,
prevent civilians from taking justice into their own hands (doxing of judges,
[judges need to be able to do their job](https://www.nvvr.org/dossiers/rechtsstaat/)
and therefore be protected), and stop participating in democratic processes.

This dashboard also forces everyone to come together and actively partake in
problem-solving, instead of getting away with the bystander effect: "If
everybody is responsible, nobody is responsible...". Not really: If everybody is
responsible, and it goes wrong, everybody is questioned and held accountable,
all go to jail!

## Preventing women getting in the situation of potential femicide

In the letter to all faculties of philosophy, psychology, organization of
psychologists, organization of municipalities of the Netherlands and Theater
School Utrecht,
[I already indicated training for women](https://github.com/andres81/Model_of_the_Psyche/blob/main/case-files/love-or-the-lack-thereof/proposal-conversation-facility-in-towns.md):
Data buffers. So conversation can be one way of preventing women stepping in the
wrong situations with the wrong kind of men:

* Walking anti-social personality disorders
* Dominant personality types
* Women haters
* Infants in adult male bodies
