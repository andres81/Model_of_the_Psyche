# Stop Femicide Now!

Enough is enough! Dutch society, you are receiving a deadline now. The last
chance I offer you now is the opportunity to help build an organization for the
protection of natural persons. If not, disrespecting the deadline or not making
it, will force me to go to the
[European Court of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights).
I myself have been subject to abuse and terror in my life that is absolutely
unacceptable. At work being fat shamed, targeted with passive-aggressive
behavior and innuendo, being burglarized and what not. Witnesses of me being
bullied and abused, because of being a witness, were subject to psychological
and emotional damage subsequently. Where was my protection? It shows again that
the moral systems like police and the legalsystem, and even society itself, or
not protecting to the point I as a citizen feel I have done morally everything
possible to prevent violations of human rights in western society. The police
force, the legal system, the government are all
[moral systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism)#Freedom_and_morality),
for
([cake eating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Marcinko)) civilians, that
we can delegate the responsibility of protecting members of society to. But only
to a certain degree, as Sartre clearly explains:

```text
Fundamentally, Sartre believed humankind cannot escape responsibility by
adopting an external moral system, as the adoption of such is in itself a choice
that we endorse – implicitly or explicitly – for which we must take full
responsibility.[13] He argues that one cannot escape this responsibility, as
each attempt to part one's self from the freedom of choice is in itself a
demonstration of choice and choice is dependent on a person's wills and desires.
He states, "I am responsible for my very desire of fleeing responsibilities."
```

Seeing
the [Dutch police fail](https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/binnenland/artikel/5492182/weiteveen-dubbele-moord-politieoptreden-richard-k-ineke-mussche)
when it comes to protecting civilians, until it is too late, and on top that,
the example of:

[Of vrouwen die paniekerig hun verhaal deelden bij de politie, maar waarbij hun angst werd gezien als ‘paranoia’.](https://www.linda.nl/persoonlijk/relaties/femicide-rode-vlaggen/)
