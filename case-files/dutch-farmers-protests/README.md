## Introduction

The way the protests were conducted by Dutch farmers is the reason to fight
back. Any behavior that is an insult to what has been accomplished in the
Netherlands, the democracy we have going on, for example, visiting a minister at
home, should not go unpunished. "But we have feelings!" So you mean to convey to
me, a Dutch civilian, you are allowed to use Dutch society as your own personal
social worker? "Bent over Dutch people, we farmers need to ventilate!" I don't
think so!

## Anti democratic rhetoric

Going to the house of natural persons because they fulfill certain roles to make
your point is, in my honest opinion, anti-democratic and dangerous. It
communicates the wrong thing how to act towards a democrazy. You acted as if you
are merely subject to said system, being a victim. However, as a participant,
you are also responsible for taking care of the democrazy and safeguarding it.
Protecting it and fighting for democrazy in the Netherlands. Consuming, not
providing, like... infants. This behavior I regard as spitting in the face of
civilians that fought hard and work hard till this day protecting our freedoms
and values we cherish so much. A big fat middle finger from farmers to us
civilians. Asbestos materials thrown on fires. Sorry what? What about our
firefighters and police professionals? All professionals tasked with dealing with
the mess you created?

## Abusing the Dutch national flag as rhetoric

Farmers trying to show how much pain they are suffering, perhaps, by hanging the
Dutch national flag upside down. What were you thinking? What support have you
left from the general public after being so aggressive against said group of
people? The same group of people that decides together what laws will be chosen
and brought in place in the Netherlands. You think you made it better for
farmers in the Netherlands after attacking the group of people that could have
actually helped you? As infants, you were raging in Dutch society, thinking that
like little children, you would get what you thought you wanted. But instead...
You now have to be careful that civil war practices don't come against you.

## Selective Activism

When you get angry, upset, don't like how the Netherlands is operating, you
start protesting the way you did. Your rhetoric being that you stand up for
farmers. But where are you when it comes to the problems farmers are facing
in Noord Brabant? Drugs criminals hijacking farms? Afraid then? I don't see
anyone on the
[Malieveld](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malieveld) then.
What about femicide? Where are you protesting because things are going wrong in
the Netherlands? Where is that Dutch Farmer fury? Why so silent...? Should the
Netherlands protest against femicide the same way you protested, and come to
your homes,
[like you did](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boerenprotesten_tegen_stikstofbeleid#Demonstraties_stikstofplannen_van_minister_Van_der_Wal_(2022))?
You try that shit one more time, I promise you there will be no protection for
what will happen then: You use civil war type actions against the people that
work hard for our democrazy, just because you are having a bad day, I promise
you it will be regarded as an act against The Netherlands by me. I have a civil
duty to protect my country, our democrazy, and the civilians in The Netherlands.
We can talk, if you choose not to, don't start crying when actions start being
used against you, and you don't like it!
Steps that will be taken then:

* Letter to the
  [European Court of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights)
* Asking the
  [Nationaal Co√∂rdinator Terrorismebestrijding en Veiligheid (NCTV)](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/contact/contactgids/nationaal-coordinator-terrorismebestrijding-en-veiligheid-nctv)
  to start an immediate intervention to stop any movement by farmers that is
  regarded as unlawful with any means necessary.
* Asking for laws to educate farmers in the form of mandatory exams and
  licensing to be allowed being a farmer in the Netherlands, like earning a
  driver's license.

## Mini Civil War

Farmers of the Netherlands, what you actually did, under the guise of protesting
for your rights and well being, was waging a civil war, that targeted civilians
and politicians. This will not be accepted! I will fight for better protection
of civilians, politicians, and anyone working in the context of the democracy we
have fought so hard for in the Netherlands. What about the
[professionals of the military](https://www.rtl.nl/rtl-nieuws/artikel/5320575/marco-kroon-omgekeerde-vlag-boeren-protest-militairen)
that saw you abusing the symbol that is the flag of the Netherlands? You think
every act used as rhetoric, any form, is legitimized by the goals for said
rhetoric? You think that will work?

To be continued...

I will fight for the rights of people, in the context of getting an
