# Society: Rules of Engagement

!!! WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

This is an evolving view of society, what it should be, society as a non-social
construct, that serves to help people live together on this planet ethically.
The ethics should be described by the construct called society itself.

In the end, each individual always has to choose themselves to go with that
view of that construct or not. 

The social construct, amongst other purposes, will serve also the goal of
[protecting us from being morally accountability for our actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism)#:~:text=Taking%20on%20the%20burden%20of%20personal%20accountability%20in%20all%20situations%20is%20an%20intimidating%20proposition%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20by%20pointing%20out%20the%20freedom%20of%20the%20individual%2C%20Sartre%20seeks%20to%20demonstrate%20that%20the%20social%20roles%20and%20moral%20systems%20we%20adopt%20protect%20us%20from%20being%20morally%20accountable%20for%20our%20actions.)

## Problems and Solutions

### #1. Yelling, drunk in public, obscene language, traumatizing young children

#### Problem description

At the time of this writing, 17 February 2024, it is a day after the author was
in the bus trying to get home. Some young folk, late teenagers, early twenties,
enter the bus (size ~10 people), that had a dynamic reminiscent of the bus scene
in [Nobody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobody_(2021_film)). There was also
a mother present, with two young daughters, ~5 and ~8 I guess. Sitting in front,
the back, and communicating from back to front, and vice versa. That is one
thing. But yelling: "Why don't you talk about doing a xx-year-old again", is one
bridge too far.
Let's analyse this situation to see what problems we have going on here.

1. The bus driver didn't do anything about the problem of harassment.
2. There are no clear rules of engagement for passengers how to deal with this
   situation in case a bus driver remains passive.
3. Society is not in the position to treat young people in such a way, that it
   is clear what is expected of them.

The bus driver, should be the responsible person in the bus, to protect the 
passengers from harmful situations. If this was a harmful situation, which it is
in the opinion of the author of this piece, then she should have acted. Possible
solutions for her could have been, to give one warning, and then ask them to
leave the bus. Another, calling the police. Yet another, talking to them to ask
what the problem is, indicating that she won't drive further if they keep
behaving like this.

Passengers could have talked to them, and indicated that they don't like it.
They could have complained to the bus driver, and left the bus. After which they
could have filed a complained with the public transport company.
Another option, could have been, being like the antagonist in Nobody. Which
would have resulted in enormous damages, potential trauma of the children
present, civil unrest, lawsuits, prosecutions, etc...
The violent escalation, could also happen after speaking up, addressing the
behaviour in the bus. The boys were intoxicated, might have been overjealous,
not in control of their own behaviour and what not. A passenger doesn't have
much options then, than to call the police themselves. But will the police come
at all? Will they come in time? Will they fix the problem, or leave it with a
warning? "Don't do this again boys!" While smiling: "Yeah, we understand, we
were young once too... ;)".

These young people, were potentially not aware of their behaviour. Punishing
them for the impact it had on others, instead of the behaviour itself, is like
punishing a dog a week after, he has shitted on the new couch of one day old,
you wished to have a romantic engagement on that same evening, but now that
didn't happen, and never did because the other person was no longer interested
after hearing this had happened...

### Conclusion

# Dutch mentality

The personal experience of the author with Dutch culture and Dutchies is often:

    Consume other people. Even if it means exploiting weaknesses that come in the
    form of emotional trauma. Don't be a thief of your own wallet. Take advantage of
    other people by consuming whatever they have to offer that one can consume.
    Whether they offer it voluntarily or not. If you see an opportunity, grab it.

The age-old [VOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company) 
mentality maybe, the Dutch never really got rid of. And what for? If
[what is considered ethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics), is nothing
more than what is contextually considered right, where the context is the social
group perceived by themselves, or the others they use. In essence saying, what
use do ethics have to begin with. Indicative of this behavior is the continuous
shifting in rhetoric. Different styles and techniques used to convey, where the
techniques consist of conveying the point of view, moral convictions, of the
individual. Merely weak attempts of trying to convince the victim into believing that
they are behaving unethical, in a context they don't fully perceive. The social
context which is equal to society that they need to survive in. Imagine becoming
a disobedient citizen and being kicked out, being thrown in jail or ending on
the streets to survive. If not that, "Hell is other people", merely the
view of others, will be enough pain to be expected in order for an individual to
conform to the will of the group.

## Organisational consequence

The thread looming on the horizon with choosing to act in such a manner and
choosing these convictions to be part of your culture, is a pyramid structure,
in which the top layer understands there is only trade and profit. The next
layer, right underneath, the aristocratic layer, in which the members believe
they are different from all other people in lower layers. They socialise with
each other and exclude socially the "peasants". Not knowing they are merely used
by the top layer, that does not perceive socialising as something worthwhile at
all: There is no social context, merely a minimal situation, in which each
individual present in said situation has the same goal: Profit. May it be
financial in nature or power.

## Techniques used

The age-old technique used, of proxying the function to give political substance
to the tasks belonging to a role that one fulfills, only works as long as the
tasks are not described precisely, but in addition people subject to the
execution of these tasks, don't actively check the quality of said execution.
One clearly deviates from the task description once political substance has been
added. Take the [Dutch childcare benefits scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_childcare_benefits_scandal)
for example. Didn't public servants proxy their functions? Racism as a starting
point when judging if civilians of the Netherlands should be "punished"? I'm
just asking, because one can never proof the intention of other people.

## Dutch Judges

What about Dutch judges? Can we know or not what their true intentions were,
when we look at how things have unfolded? To what extent can you give the
benefit of the doubt, and judge they were a victim of their situation? Acting
out of incompetence, or actually acting with bad intent, and bad faith in the
form of denying you were acting with bad intent? But wait... Sartre! What about
being "condemned to be free"?
["One must not exercise bad faith by denying the self's freedom of choice and
accountability."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism)#:~:text=One%20must%20not%20exercise%20bad%20faith%20by%20denying%20the%20self%27s%20freedom%20of%20choice%20and%20accountability.)
Couldn't Dutch judges resign to prevent ruling the way they did, and harming
civilians, of which they said in [hindsight](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hindsight),
[they regret how things happened](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5259123/toeslagenaffaire-rechters-oneerlijk-rapport-rechtsstaat-kritisch#:~:text=In%20het%20rapport%20maken%20de%20rechters%20gehakt%20van%20de%20alles%2Dof%2Dniets%2Dregel%20die%20zij%20moesten%20volgen.%20Volgens%20die%20regel%20mocht%20de%20Belastingdienst%20bij%20%C3%A9lke%20afwijking%20de%20hele%20kinderopvangtoeslag%20terugeisen.)?

## Politics

Then politics. [Offering apologies to the victims of the benefits scandal.](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/politiek/artikel/5254215/persoonlijk-excuus-kabinet-voor-gedupeerden-toeslagenaffaire)
But, can a government or any non-natural person ever apologize? Does that work?
What is an apology anyway? In what context does it work? In what type of
situations does it make sense, in which does it not?

One only makes apologies in a social context. It is a method of healing and
repairing social relationships, and ones own social position in a social group.
Did politicians try to heal the relationship between victims of the scandal and
the government? Hoping to regain trust of not only the victims, but of citizens
in general? If so, how can you proof to me, a citizen myself, the author of this
piece ('of %^*&' if you want), that you are not making it way too easy for
yourself? By saying you merely have to apologise to heal trust in the
"system", you don't have to do the hard work anymore of doing the analysis, explaining the
outcome of that analysis, and coming up with a fix of the problem that was
analysed. That, my dear politicians, is your job. Yes, it is not easy, and if
you fail at that, you might lose trust and might be considered an amateur. But, in
the end, you chose your job. And if we, as a society, chose the job description
of a member of the parliament, you just have to do your job, and not try to
trick us with [We, the people at Toilet Duck, recommend Toilet Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_Duck#:~:text=In%20the%20Netherlands%2C%20the%20advertising%20slogan%20%22Wij%20van%20Wc%2Deend%20adviseren%20Wc%2Deend%22%20(%22We%2C%20the%20people%20at%20Toilet%20Duck%2C%20recommend%20Toilet%20Duck%22)%20was%20used%20in%20a%20campaign%20that%20ended%20in%201996.)
mentality rhetoric, saying you will tell us what your job is.

This continuous trickery, the Toilet Duck magic trick, isn't that debit now to
the [growing loss of trust of civilians in the government](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5426691/onderzoek-scp-omverwerpen-overheidssysteem-hardere-acties-regering)?
Too much trust in ones own competence, ignoring signals from outside, and
silencing any form of protest from within? One cannot state this for an
organisation as big as the Dutch government. But does the majority of civilians
understand this? Can they comprehend the size of the government? Merely the
number of individual departments, subunits, task-forces is overwhelming.

## A possible solution: Organisation for the protection of the natural person

What is needed is protection that truly protects at any point in any process
involving a natural person interacting with any component of society that is not
a natural person itself. It implies an organisation for the protection of
natural persons, that, in a legal context as an attorney, acts on behalf of the
client. This forms a trinity, that as a construct, acts as a protector of the
natural person at any time a natural person, interacts with any form of
organisation in society, that is not a natural person. In addition, this will
relieve the pressure of non-natural person agents acting in society, of their
moral obligations to the point of always being responsible for their actions.
An example is the interaction of a natural person interacting with a public
servant. If there are only two people present, the public servant, and the
natural person, when
the public servant proxies the role, the natural person that fulfills the role
of being a public servant, causing the natural person to become aggressive,
it is the municipality that will retaliate. This gives too much power to natural
persons, fulfilling the role of public servants. One can easily ventilate
personal frustrations with society through their function by proxying it. Who
will check for this? The natural person is overburdened with responsibility by
society, if it is expected from the person itself. You act from a subjective
position, and that implies lack of rational view of the situation. Doctors don't
heal themselves: General Physicians, go to colleagues.

### Examples of existing organisations protecting natural persons

Acting on behalf of or supporting a natural person is already done, by for
example [labor unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union). The problem
here is, they only act in certain contexts, not in all possible situations.
Other examples consist of [human rights organisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_rights_organisations).
