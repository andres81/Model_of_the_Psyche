# Society: Rules of Engagement

!!! WORK IN PROGRESS!!!


// KLAD

Consuming the situation that you created merely for the purpose to consume it in
the first place. At the cost of anyone or anything as long as you think you get
away with it.

// 


This is an evolving view of society, what it should be, society as a non-social
construct, that serves to help people live together on this planet ethically.
The ethics should be described by the construct called society itself.

In the end, each individual always has to choose themselves to go with that
view of that construct or not. 

The social construct, amongst other purposes, will serve also the goal of
[protecting us from being morally accountability for our actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism).)

# Feminism Revisited

        For Simone. To you, who showed the world the power of women and their
        love to give to the world. Not being merely a social construct, the
        social construct once women perceived to merely be. But instead, so much
        more. The love you gave, will never be forgotten, at the very least, not
        by my.

"I will merely play my roll as a woman in my next relationship. I won't
complicate things unnecessarily anymore."

If the only way women know how to engage with a man in the context of love, is
by giving herself physically and sexually, after which she expects there to be love,
coming from the man, as she, with her instincts, will feel love for him, if he
did his job right, then what use is it to her to invest anything more during courtship?
Like talking
first during extensive conversations, walking in the park, going to museums,
during a proper courtship period? It won't make him love her... right? Isn't he
interested in her? Projecting her own experience of love onto the man.

Ending up in a social situation, in itself being a social construct that the
relationship and later marriage is. But in itself no longer serving a purpose as
the social context changes, as people leave the social group and context therefore. But
also, the longer being together, anyway getting to know each other non-socially,
who the other person really is. The woman finding out, she is missing something.
Not the connection she has with friends, she might now be wanting with her partner.
That set of inner core believes regarding the world, she has always been hiding,
except for inner circle close friends, people she trusts and cares about. The experience
she perceived as only possible to have with people other than your partner.
What job does a man have? Father of your children, being the man in your life,
fitting the profile of the social construct tha man is, that in the context of the
relationship has to serve the woman's social life, not damage it, her reputation,
the view of others have of her, others that become hell, if he is not that, that
what he should be. Although he might be great in bed, great conversation buddy,
is it worth the trouble to find that man? If so, how?

But do women not understand this at all? Or do they know, and do older women tell them this?
Young women knowing how it works, understanding it. Men have no more to offer,
then the consequence in the form of their behavior due to their simple
understanding of their surroundings. The inner child still being present, never
really being taken care of.
Women being a victim of a limited set of options, from which to choose, and accept
their fate. Eventually, the heroes that they are of society, simply choosing to 
make it easier for the guys that come after you, which in her case, are the kids.
No love in this marriage, maybe even a sexless one, but suffer for those that
come after me. I will merely play my roll in this situation.

"Go with his drama, play your roll, once with him, you will have
what you need. Children, sex, affection, safety. Society simply doesn't have
more to offer now..."

Being a victim of the state society finds itself in now.

But women always will eventually find out, how it is to be with a love partner
that you share your inner, core beliefs with. Talking being more important than
sex at that moment of being intimate with each other with merely words. Pushing
out everybody from the social situation, that are present in the physical
situation you find yourself in. Only to being brought back to reality in the
harshest way possible. Reality sets in, when you go home, with the other guy:
Your husband, partner, "best friend". Is it fair to women to not help them, find
that guy, whose energy she likes, feels safe with, finding the intimacy with
while talking etc?
If we just give women the experience of real love, the alignment of deepest
conviction between two people, the experience of talking with each other being
enough.

# Role of society to cater for the needs of women in a male dominated world

## Female students

Fraternities, student-societies, have clearly [failed](https://andreschepers.nl/#bullying-at-work-and-in-education),
in offering an addendum to the experiences a student goes through. Instead of
constructive experiences to aid and add to the growth process, and making happy
memories, females are abused, damaged, scorned, and given the experience of a
society that couldn't care less.

Let's not complain here, in this work of writing, but instead look at a solution
and a design of a system, offered as a proposal to the members of society, to
put in place, in order to be able to rely on a moral system that

# Public Transport

## Problems and Solutions

### #1. Yelling, drunk in public, obscene language, traumatizing young children

#### Problem description

At the time of this writing, 17 February 2024, it is a day after the author was
in the bus trying to get home. Some young folk, late teenagers, early twenties,
enter the bus (size ~10 people), that had a dynamic reminiscent of the bus scene
in [Nobody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobody_(2021_film)). There was also
a mother present, with two young daughters, ~5 and ~8 I guess. Sitting in front,
the back, and communicating from back to front, and vice versa. That is one
thing. But yelling: "Why don't you talk about doing a xx-year-old again", is one
bridge too far.
Let's analyse this situation to see what problems we have going on here.

1. The bus driver didn't do anything about the problem of harassment.
2. There are no clear rules of engagement for passengers how to deal with this
   situation in case a bus driver remains passive.
3. Society is not in the position to treat young people in such a way, that it
   is clear what is expected of them.

The bus driver, should be the responsible person in the bus, to protect the 
passengers from harmful situations. If this was a harmful situation, which it is
in the opinion of the author of this piece, then she should have acted. Possible
solutions for her could have been, to give one warning, and then ask them to
leave the bus. Another, calling the police. Yet another, talking to them to ask
what the problem is, indicating that she won't drive further if they keep
behaving like this.

Passengers could have talked to them, and indicated that they don't like it.
They could have complained to the bus driver, and left the bus. After which they
could have filed a complained with the public transport company.
Another option, could have been, being like the antagonist in Nobody. Which
would have resulted in enormous damages, potential trauma of the children
present, civil unrest, lawsuits, prosecutions, etc...
The violent escalation, could also happen after speaking up, addressing the
behaviour in the bus. The boys were intoxicated, might have been overzealous,
not in control of their own behaviour and what not. A passenger doesn't have
many options then, than to call the police themselves. But will the police come
at all? Will they come in time? Will they fix the problem, or leave it with a
warning? "Don't do this again boys!" While smiling: "Yeah, we understand, we
were young once too... ;)".

These young people, were potentially not aware of their behaviour. Punishing
them for the impact it had on others, instead of the behaviour itself, is like
punishing a dog a week after, because he shitted on the new couch of one day old,
you wished to have a romantic engagement on that same evening, but now that
didn't happen, and never did because the other person was no longer interested
after hearing this had happened...

#### Solution description

Let's super position these problems into one, and find one solution that gives
us the desired outcome.
All problems have in common, that the behaviour needs to be stopped
immediately, to prevent damage. Trauma to the passengers, behaviour by the young
group that will get them in trouble, societal unrest due to this incident.
So let's start by stopping this behaviour in its tracks and see what actors
are responsible to stop this behaviour. Furthermore, what are the escalation
paths.

1. The bus driver.

The bus driver is responsible for the safety of the passengers. In the case of
young people, that don't control their behaviour enough yet, especially not when
intoxicated with alcohol, and having alcohol on them, drinking it in the bus,
the bus driver has to ask them the next stop, to leave the bus. There is no
excuse for letting them remain on the bus. Exit! We have to define the Rules of
Engagement for passengers and the public transport companies. The rules are as
follows to be in the bus, that the bus driver has to enforce:

* You talk with people, don't yell.
* You talk with the people that choose to talk with you, don't enforce talking.
* You don't drink in the bus.
* If asked to leave, you leave.

Failure to comply, means immediately being invited to leave the bus the next
stop. A bus driver that does not act, is complicit to the wrongful act.

2. Passengers

Passengers in the bus, keep an eye on the behaviour of others. If acting
wrongfully, the bus driver needs to be asked to act. If the driver remains
passive, the passenger calls the police. The police has to take over and let the
situation be restored to a save one.

3. Society

As a society, it is necessary to proactively communicate, discuss, and evolve
ideas regarding what is expected from individuals within the context.
What the context is, depends on everybodies views, but moreover, some
tend to lean towards the view of not needing a clear concept, but just
use what ever is in front of you.

### Conclusion

# Societal exclusion of minorities based on geography, culture or ethnicity by way of social engineering

# Love

If a man sees the partner, a woman, in a heterosexual relationship, as an
object, including the sex rituals, the relationship itself and the view others
have of the relationship and the man in the context of said relationship, how
does that reflect on the psyche of and the experience of the relationship by the
woman? If a love relationship and the engagement with one, is considered as
merely a social construct in the context of a perceived social group, what are
the consequences? Not only psychological, but also in terms of the longevity of
the relationship, the others and society?
When a woman knows and feels she is merely an object in the eyes of her partner,
she starts realising that all the rituals in the relationship, are part of
playing a role in the context. Contexts switch, so do the roles that are
expected to be played.
When she breaks up with him, she might opt for a clean, cold exit. He might be
wondering why she doesn't have the emotions he projects onto her consisting of
love and affection for him. But once one realises, that real emotions are not
there, due to the fact she realised before that the relationship was merely a
social construct, it is understandable that there are no emotions, nor have
there ever been.
When women are raised by upbringing, society and experiences, that the above is
what there is, and nothing else, no Hollywood romantic real love, then she might
choose her money's worth in the form of accepting the minimal love situation she
sees as the only option, and go for extra's. Extra's can come in several forms:

* A man making good money, 100k, 150k, 200k...
* He is good-looking, will age well
* He has high social standing, which will be given to her once together
* He has the ability to give her children with the good genes she perceives him
  having. (Perceives, because autism flies below the radar, as is the case with
  the author. All nice and dandy, until she finds out that thát is going on, and
  she will look one door further down the road.)

The above will result in two individuals regarding relationships as engagements
like you see with formal business ones. Everything is calculated, trust is low,
knowing the other person can at anytime step out of the engagement, in favor of
a better (business) partner. "No hard feelings, no offense, strictly business".

If women instead receive better experiences, how would the world look like then?
If women can act like women, men will receive the care and patience and love
that they need from a partner, to remain healthy. Wasn't it shown in social
psychology, that men have a 10 times higher chance to die after divorce, than
women? And why was that the case? Because women talk with each other, and
regulate their emotions through their social relations, while men only have
their wives to talk to until divorce.<br/>
If humans engage with the world, based on how they are taught to perceive it,
how are women raised and educated on how to engage with men? Is courtship
something that happens only in the context of a social situation? How should a
man be evaluated to decide if he is proper marriage material? Is a love
relationship a form or type of social relationship, or not at all?

Love is between two people, not between a person and the other persons social
group. If a woman checks with her social group, she perceives being part of,
if he is good partner material, if at all she has the intention to want the man
for a long term relationship, doesn't she end up marrying and having children
with a man she hardly knows, except for the social role he is playing? When you
have children, you find out the hard way, social rules might not apply in
interactions with other human beings: Children don't care about your social
status. If you are not a team as the parents, children will smell the weaknesses
and start exploiting them. He will also stop playing the social role he was
playing in the relationship, because other people, your children, changed the
rules of engagement. You no longer can keep up the window dressing necessary
for a social situation. No more social facade, because it simply doesn't work
towards your children, they need you to play a different role. Once this plays
out, a woman can easily just leave. But what is different all of a sudden? How
come you never got to know the other person? What is there to know and how do
you approach this problem when looking for a partner?<br ?>
Women effectively have only a few years once they hit 20. If they keep playing
with love like teenagers do, when men subsequently opt out, because they realise
they are the price, not the women, they will choose the wrong partner, will be
unhappy, and society is left with societal collapse because not enough babies
are born.

# Dutch mentality

The personal experience of the author with Dutch culture and Dutchies is often:

    Consume other people. Even if it means exploiting weaknesses that come in the
    form of emotional trauma. Don't be a thief of your own wallet. Take advantage of
    other people by consuming whatever they have to offer that one can consume.
    Whether they offer it voluntarily or not. If you see an opportunity, grab it.

The age-old [VOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company) 
[mentality](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/VOC-mentaliteit) maybe, the Dutch never really got rid of. And what for? If
[what is considered ethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics), is nothing
more than what is contextually considered right, where the context is the social
group perceived by themselves, or the others they use. In essence saying, what
use do ethics have to begin with. Indicative of this behavior is the continuous
shifting in rhetoric. Different styles and techniques used to convey, where the
techniques consist of conveying the point of view, moral convictions, of the
individual. Merely weak attempts of trying to convince the victim into believing that
they are behaving unethical, in a context they don't fully perceive. The social
context which is equal to society that they need to survive in. Imagine becoming
a disobedient citizen and being kicked out, being thrown in jail or ending on
the streets to survive. If not that, "Hell is other people", merely the
view of others, will be enough pain to be expected in order for an individual to
conform to the will of the group.

## Organisational consequence

The thread looming on the horizon with choosing to act in such a manner and
choosing these convictions to be part of your culture, is a pyramid structure,
in which the top layer understands there is only trade and profit. The next
layer, right underneath, the aristocratic layer, in which the members believe
they are different from all other people in lower layers. They socialise with
each other and exclude socially the "peasants". Not knowing they are merely used
by the top layer, that does not perceive socialising as something worthwhile at
all: There is no social context, merely a minimal situation, in which each
individual present in said situation has the same goal: Profit. May it be
financial in nature or power.

## Techniques used

The age-old technique used, of proxying the function to give political substance
to the tasks belonging to a role that one fulfills, only works as long as the
tasks are not described precisely, but in addition people subject to the
execution of these tasks, don't actively check the quality of said execution.
One clearly deviates from the task description once political substance has been
added. Take the [Dutch childcare benefits scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_childcare_benefits_scandal)
for example. Didn't public servants proxy their functions? Racism as a starting
point when judging if civilians of the Netherlands should be "punished"? I'm
just asking, because one can never proof the intention of other people.

## Dutch Judges

What about Dutch judges? Can we know or not what their true intentions were,
when we look at how things have unfolded? To what extent can you give the
benefit of the doubt, and judge they were a victim of their situation? Acting
out of incompetence, or actually acting with bad intent, and bad faith in the
form of denying you were acting with bad intent? But wait... Sartre! What about
being "condemned to be free"?
["One must not exercise bad faith by denying the self's freedom of choice and
accountability."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism)#:~:text=One%20must%20not%20exercise%20bad%20faith%20by%20denying%20the%20self%27s%20freedom%20of%20choice%20and%20accountability.)
Couldn't Dutch judges resign to prevent ruling the way they did, and harming
civilians, of which they said in [hindsight](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hindsight),
[they regret how things happened](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5259123/toeslagenaffaire-rechters-oneerlijk-rapport-rechtsstaat-kritisch#:~:text=In%20het%20rapport%20maken%20de%20rechters%20gehakt%20van%20de%20alles%2Dof%2Dniets%2Dregel%20die%20zij%20moesten%20volgen.%20Volgens%20die%20regel%20mocht%20de%20Belastingdienst%20bij%20%C3%A9lke%20afwijking%20de%20hele%20kinderopvangtoeslag%20terugeisen.)?

## Politics

Then politics. [Offering apologies to the victims of the benefits scandal.](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/politiek/artikel/5254215/persoonlijk-excuus-kabinet-voor-gedupeerden-toeslagenaffaire)
But, can a government or any non-natural person ever apologize? Does that work?
What is an apology anyway? In what context does it work? In what type of
situations does it make sense, in which does it not?

One only makes apologies in a social context. It is a method of healing and
repairing social relationships, and ones own social position in a social group.
Did politicians try to heal the relationship between victims of the scandal and
the government? Hoping to regain trust of not only the victims, but of citizens
in general? If so, how can you proof to me, a citizen myself, the author of this
piece ('of %^*&' if you want), that you are not making it way too easy for
yourself? By saying you merely have to apologise to heal trust in the
"system", you don't have to do the hard work anymore of doing the analysis, explaining the
outcome of that analysis, and coming up with a fix of the problem that was
analysed. That, my dear politicians, is your job. Yes, it is not easy, and if
you fail at that, you might lose trust and might be considered an amateur. But, in
the end, you chose your job. And if we, as a society, chose the job description
of a member of the parliament, you just have to do your job, and not try to
trick us with [We, the people at Toilet Duck, recommend Toilet Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_Duck#:~:text=In%20the%20Netherlands%2C%20the%20advertising%20slogan%20%22Wij%20van%20Wc%2Deend%20adviseren%20Wc%2Deend%22%20(%22We%2C%20the%20people%20at%20Toilet%20Duck%2C%20recommend%20Toilet%20Duck%22)%20was%20used%20in%20a%20campaign%20that%20ended%20in%201996.)
mentality rhetoric, saying you will tell us what your job is.

This continuous trickery, the Toilet Duck magic trick, isn't that debit now to
the [growing loss of trust of civilians in the government](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5426691/onderzoek-scp-omverwerpen-overheidssysteem-hardere-acties-regering)?
Too much trust in ones own competence, ignoring signals from outside, and
silencing any form of protest from within? One cannot state this for an
organisation as big as the Dutch government. But does the majority of civilians
understand this? Can they comprehend the size of the government? Merely the
number of individual departments, subunits, task-forces is overwhelming.

## A possible solution: Organisation for the protection of the natural person

What is needed is protection that truly protects at any point in any process
involving a natural person interacting with any component of society that is not
a natural person itself. It implies an organisation for the protection of
natural persons, that, in a legal context as an attorney, acts on behalf of the
client. This forms a trinity, that as a construct, acts as a protector of the
natural person at any time a natural person, interacts with any form of
organisation in society, that is not a natural person. In addition, this will
relieve the pressure of non-natural person agents acting in society, of their
moral obligations to the point of always being responsible for their actions.
An example is the interaction of a natural person interacting with a public
servant. If there are only two people present, the public servant, and the
natural person, when
the public servant proxies the role, the natural person that fulfills the role
of being a public servant, causing the natural person to become aggressive,
it is the municipality that will retaliate. This gives too much power to natural
persons, fulfilling the role of public servants. One can easily ventilate
personal frustrations with society through their function by proxying it. Who
will check for this? The natural person is overburdened with responsibility by
society, if it is expected from the person itself. You act from a subjective
position, and that implies lack of rational view of the situation. Doctors don't
heal themselves: General Physicians, go to colleagues.

### Examples of existing organisations protecting natural persons

Acting on behalf of or supporting a natural person is already done, by for
example [labor unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union). The problem
here is, they only act in certain contexts, not in all possible situations.
Other examples consist of [human rights organisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_rights_organisations).
