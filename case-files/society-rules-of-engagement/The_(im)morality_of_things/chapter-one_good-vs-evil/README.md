# What is good and does evil exist as something in itself

Proof that Nazi's were evil, according to what philosophy, or merely an ideology
the west disapproved because of its own set of convictions, ideology. Was the
defeat of the Nazi empire merely a conflict between ideologies of which one
won, or truly the defeat of evil in the context of two opposites: Good vs evil.
If not clear, the legitimisation of defeating that which is truly evil, gets
lost in translation. Wisdom that was gathered that was carried by culture, when
lost, will not be able to be used to protect what is necessary to allow good
people to do good.
