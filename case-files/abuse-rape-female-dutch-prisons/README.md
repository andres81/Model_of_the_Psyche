## Introduction

So let me get this straight. We have prisons in which we lock up women, because
a judge has decided that the crime for which a person is convicted, has been
proven. And the sentence should be prison time. But in addition, people that
work for the government, think it is allowed to treat people like animals?
Abusing and raping women in the most controlled situation possible? Controlled
by the Dutch government? Does the Netherlands think this is okay? If not, what
is Dutch society doing about this? How do you check that it does not happen
again? Are Dutch citizens, women, protected now in prisons in the Netherlands
from the government itself? The government, should understand, that public
servants and employees of the government, act always on behalf of the
government. The government is fully, 100%, responsible for the behaviour of these
people. But the citizens of the Netherlands, are responsible for the actions of
their government. What are citizens doing about this problem? Are they seeing it
even as a problem? A lot of questions to be answered. And fast!

The author of this piece, had a personal experience in Ter Apel, with a [DJI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custodial_Institutions_Agency)
employee: I was challenged by a guard, when visiting the prison during an open
day. Was that behaviour an example of how prisoners are treated? Challenging
them to create a situation in which you can do something against the prisoner
that you got into a certain state? What is going on?
Another remark from this same guard, while looking at prisoners exercising:
"Yes, they have a right to do this...". It was the undertone that hit me, the
implicit set of convictions. This behaviour is to me proxying of the function
to give political substance to the tasks to be executed that belong to the role
the employee is fulfilling. What convictions were communicated here? And which,
that are not inline with what we agreed upon in the Netherlands, are put in
practice? How do we check that? What kind of culture is created and maintained
within the Dutch prison system? How much do we know? Can we know? Are prisoners
still seen as humanbeings? Is a prison sentence in the Netherlands, more than
only being robbed of your freedom? Implicitly, in addition to loosing your
freedom, also the possible abuse and rape by prison guards in female prisons,
that do whatever they like?

It is time that citizens take a more proactive role in partaking in society. It
is time to show the government and government employees, that society decides
the rules, not some employees with their personal set of convictions!
It is time for an organisation for the protection of natural persons. One that
over arches all the organisations that help people in specific circumstances. One
that fights for human rights, and specialises in helping natural persons and
other organisations to help any natural person, whenever and wherever.

## Analysis

Let's analyse the system that has allowed for this disaster: The violation of
human rights by the Dutch government.

The government, has done research into how the prison was operating and concluded
it was all [nice and dandy](https://www.inspectie-jenv.nl/Publicaties/rapporten/2013/10/02/pi-utrecht-nieuwersluis).
Sure, it shows again, to the author at least, that the government is not capable
or willing, to come with systems that we can trust to 
[protect us from being morally accountability for our actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism)#:~:text=Taking%20on%20the%20burden%20of%20personal%20accountability%20in%20all%20situations%20is%20an%20intimidating%20proposition%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20by%20pointing%20out%20the%20freedom%20of%20the%20individual%2C%20Sartre%20seeks%20to%20demonstrate%20that%20the%20social%20roles%20and%20moral%20systems%20we%20adopt%20protect%20us%20from%20being%20morally%20accountable%20for%20our%20actions.).
But what systems are currently in place? Does the government have the intention
at all to put systems in place with at least the reason to prevent violation of
human rights? In other words, is prevention a goal in itself, to put systems in
place, and determining in part the choice of systems being used to execute
policy governed by the government? 

If for example it is implied that the responsibility to prevent the violation of
human rights, is something that the government chooses to delegate to an
institution, and in addition not explicitly communicating that the government
sees it as the responsibility of an institution like a
prison, finger pointing starts once it goes wrong, like in the case of rapes in
prisons. It is not the responsibility of the natural persons working in the
context of the prison, it is not the government either, it is not the system to
blame, but maybe [merely the culture within the organisation](https://www.inspectie-jenv.nl/Publicaties/rapporten/2023/05/31/rapport-pi-nieuwersluis).

But what is culture? One definition is:
[The set of predominating attitudes and behavior that characterize a group or organization](https://www.wordnik.com/words/culture)
Going with this definition, when an organization/institution leans on the
effectiveness of the culture resulting from internal dynamics, social and what
not, an escalating set of attitudes might lead to undesired outcomes, that are
hard to spot. Also, who are held responsible? There is room for way too much
politics.
Also, to what extent are individuals held accountable for their actions? How is
proxying of the function to give political substance to the tasks belonging to 
the role defined by the team the natural person has to fulfil discouraged? Is
it at all possible to hold individuals accountable, for said proxying, when you
communicate clearly as a government to an organization, you are expected to use
culture as a control mechanism of behavior of individual natural persons with
their function and roles assigned? How do you assess individual performance, in
the context of functioning within the context of a culture, with implicit and
informal rules? How do you keep track of cultural values, attitudes, if you do
wish to formalise them, but let them be created natural, which is in case of a
cultural situation, the only way?
Was the above even checked by the government? In other words, was anything put
in explicit writing?

The solution is very simple:

* Strict function definitions.
* The roles defined by the teams in which natural persons work, checked
  proactively (not after something goes wrong), by the organization and an
  external government agency.
* Because we are working with human beings, the natural persons, in this case
  the prisoners, need to have a clear line of communication with the external
  organization that on behalf of the government checks if all is well. Any
  complaint, is taken serious, especially if it concerns the highest level of
  unethical behaviour. Any signal ignored, should result in severe penalties for
  the people involved. That includes, and maybe especially, the warden of the
  prison.
