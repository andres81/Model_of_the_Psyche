## Introduction

So let me get this straight. We have prisons in which we lock up women, because
a judge has decided that the crime for which a person is convicted, has been
proven. And the sentence should be prison time. But in addition, people that
work for the government, think it is allowed to treat people like animals?
Abusing and raping women in the most controlled situation possible? Controlled
by the Dutch government? Does the Netherlands think this is okay? If not, what
is Dutch society doing about this? How do you check that it does not happen
again? Are Dutch citizens, women, protected now in prisons in the Netherlands
from the government itself? The government, should understand, that public
servants and employees of the government, act always on behalf of the
government. The government is fully, 100%, responsible for the behaviour of these
people. But the citizens of the Netherlands, are responsible for the actions of
their government. What are citizens doing about this problem? Are they seeing it
even as a problem? A lot of questions to be answered. And fast!

The author of this piece, had a personal experience in Ter Apel, with a [DJI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custodial_Institutions_Agency)
employee: I was challenged by a guard, when visiting the prison during an open
day. Was that behaviour an example of how prisoners are treated? Challenging
them to create a situation in which you can do something against the prisoner
that you got into a certain state? What is going on?
Another remark from this same guard, while looking at prisoners exercising:
"Yes, they have a right to do this...". It was the undertone that hit me, the
implicit set of convictions. This behaviour is to me proxying of the function
to give political substance to the tasks to be executed that belong to the role
the employee is fulfilling. What convictions were communicated here? And which,
that are not inline with what we agreed upon in the Netherlands, are put in
practice? How do we check that? What kind of culture is created and maintained
within the Dutch prison system? How much do we know? Can we know? Are prisoners
still seen as humanbeings? Is a prison sentence in the Netherlands, more than
only being robbed of your freedom? Implicitly, in addition to loosing your
freedom, also the possible abuse and rape by prison guards in female prisons,
that do whatever they like?

It is time that citizens take a more proactive role in partaking in society. It
is time to show the government and government employees, that society decides
the rules, not some employees with their personal set of convictions!
It is time for an organisation for the protection of natural persons. One that
overarches all the organisations that help people in specific circumstances. One
that fights for human rights, and specialises in helping natural persons and
other organisations to help any natural person, whenever and wherever.

## Analysis

Let's analyse the system that has allowed for this disaster: The violation of
human rights by the Dutch government.
