## Introduction

24th of January 2021, police was tasked with stopping riots in Eindhoven and
Amsterdam. The use of a water canon was authorised and used in Eindhoven. At a
certain point during the riots, as can be seen in the video in
[this article](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5327086/politiebond-geirriteerd-over-vervolging-agente-van-waterkanon),
a woman is targeted, from a short distance, while she is trying to move by,
posing absolutely no thread at all. The consequences of being hit, as reported
by her, are disastrous:

* Skull fracture
* Cut in the face
* Psychological trauma

The question here is, was this action, the action consisting of choosing to use
the power of the water canon in this situation justified. But there is another
issue at hand: [The response of the police unions](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5327086/politiebond-geirriteerd-over-vervolging-agente-van-waterkanon).

The police union ACP was "ge√Ørriteerd", which translates to: [irritated](https://translate.google.com/details?sl=auto&tl=en&text=ge%C3%AFrriteerd&op=translate)
over the choice to prosecute the police officer that operated the water canon
against the woman that got hurt subsequently.

## Actions

An article with some rhetoric, by an author that doesn't even have a bachelors
degree, does not do much for anyone, but burn energy resources by some
internet servers hosting the website on which the article can be read.
Instead, what is more effective, is an open letter asking for justification for
the actions described in this article.

1. Police actions, consisting of using a water canon.
2. Union actions, consisting of the responses that were given to the media.
