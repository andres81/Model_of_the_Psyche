# Introduction

# Young people

## Dating

Dating is a mess. It simply doesn't work anymore, or does it? How to get a date
in the first place? Where are the 90's when people still started conversations
with strangers in the train? Why do the young people of today seem more shy to
start a conversation with strangers?

According to your author, it is because people spent more time on screen, and
not enough talking with others. It doesn't matter with whom, but talking, or
more in general interacting with other people, trains the mental muscles.

This training, exercising, is that done enough at the moment by young people,
with the means available? At school, at work, in cafe/bars, with friends, at
sports clubs, through dating... The common denominator here: When it gets
difficult, people tend to project the awkwardness of the situation onto the
other person, and subsequently concluding that that person is not their type.
Also, then ending the interaction too quick. While, in reality it might be due
to a lack of skill, perception and/or control of emotions: Lack of inner coping
mechanisms and engagement strategies.
Also, with the means described, people choose their "type" of people. Type then
defined by the way choose to socialise, and to start with: Socialising. There is
also a non-social interaction possible. Especially when it comes to dating,
shouldn't you be looking for someone you match with, without a social situation
present nor necessary to get a long nicely? This, because when kids come, that
social situation you were in control of, will be gone. If you don't get along
outside a social situation, you will face huge troubles. Might this be a
cause of high divorce rates?

Instead, engage with complete strangers, in a chosen non-social situation giving
a non-social context in which you engage each other with a conversation. If,
and only if you then align on the deepest convictions levels of the both of you,
wouldn't you then not feel true love, reminiscent of what
[Simone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir)
and
[Jean-Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre)
felt? If not that, at the very least you have trained the muscles concerning
human interaction again. Often, people cannot deal with the reflection of
themselves in the eyes of the person they talk with. Using social contracts,
they might try to manage what reflections they get returned. But to what extent
do you wish to manage your outside world? External engagement strategies as a
compensation of inadequate internal coping mechanisms that cause pain inside,
that come in the form of manipulating and forming social situations people are
subject to? Just asking questions I guess...



# Students: "Langstudeerboete"

Students are [self-actualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization).
They are not on a holiday, but instead of enjoying their youth, studying,
working in their spare time when not studying for a little money, to then spent
it again on the expansive books and college tuition fees. Saying then that [it
costs society 5 times as much](https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/artikel/5454539/studenten-komen-actie-tegen-langstudeerboete-we-zijn-geen-pin-automoaat),
compared to what the students have to pay in
terms of tuition fees, is moral pressure, for people that have barely started
partaking in society, still forming their moral compass. How unfair is that?

If you want to make this calculation, how much students cost and what we get
back for this, let's do this properly: Let's look at what the REAL Return On
Investment (ROI) is! The pay for the labor of academics and college graduates at
work in society, versus what the value is of the labor itself to society, versus
what it costed society to have students self-actualize during their studies at
the colleges and universities.
