## Introduction

## Students: "Langstudeerboete"

Students are [self-actualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization).
They are not on a holiday, but instead of enjoying their youth, studying,
working in their spare time when not studying for a little money, to then spent
it again on the expansive books and college tuition fees. Saying then that [it
costs society 5 times as much](https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/artikel/5454539/studenten-komen-actie-tegen-langstudeerboete-we-zijn-geen-pin-automoaat),
compared to what the students have to pay in
terms of tuition fees, is moral pressure, for people that have barely started
partaking in society, still forming their moral compass. How unfair is that?

If you want to make this calculation, how much students cost and what we get
back for this, let's do this properly: Let's look at what the REAL Return On
Investment (ROI) is! The pay for the labor of academics and college graduates at
work in society, versus what the value is of the labor itself to society, versus
what it costed society to have students self-actualize during their studies at
the colleges and universities.
