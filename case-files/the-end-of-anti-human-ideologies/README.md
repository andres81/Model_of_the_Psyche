# The End of Anti-Human Ideologies

An ideology,
a ["coherent system of ideas"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology#Definitions_and_analysis),
depending on the context the term is used, can be interpreted in different ways.
Social sciences versus political vs psychological... and so on. In this writing
an ideology will be referring to just that, a coherent system of ideas, carried
by a group of people. That group could be a municipality, a country, or
subgroups, a family, but at least having 3 people as members.

Fascism, is a coherent system of ideas, for example. But what does it lead to?
Genocide? Is it anti-human because humans will destroy humanity if this ideology
becomes leading? What is important to realise is, that one can imagine that
ideologies exist, that can destroy humanity. But looking at the outer context,
the universe, it is against what seems to be the goal: Create life, live and let
live, evolve ideas, life, love. Aggression causes ripples in the fabric of the
universe, and the universe subsequently will push back. He who is in tune with
the universe, will feel these ripples. A human being is only on earth for a
little while. Like a cell in a human body, do you contribute to let the body
live and survive, or become a cancer cell that grows uncontrollably, sucking up
all resources and space in its environment, just for the purpose of growing. As
an uncontrollable hungry thermodynamic process, reminiscent of black holes in
the universe, destroying the host, again, like black holes do. If one than
wishes to discuss if violence by one thermodynamic process against another is
justified, only look at the reason: Is that violence committed by an
uncontrollable thermodynamic process with the soul purpose to grow? Or committed
by a "healthy" thermodynamic process, stopping an uncontrollable one. This can
be reasoned about. But only after having agreed on this definition and
foundation of understanding of the outermost context we exist within.
