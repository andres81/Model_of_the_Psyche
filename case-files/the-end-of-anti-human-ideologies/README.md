# The End of Anti-Human Ideologies

An ideology,
a ["coherent system of ideas"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology#Definitions_and_analysis),
depending on the context the term is used, can be interpreted in different ways.
Social sciences versus political vs psychological... and so on. In this writing
an ideology will be referring to just that, a coherent system of ideas, carried
by a group of people. That group could be a municipality, a country, or
subgroups, a family, but at least having 3 people as members.

Fascism, is a coherent system of ideas, for example. But what does it lead to?
Genocide? Is it anti-human because humans will destroy humanity if this ideology
becomes leading? What is important to realise is, that one can imagine that
ideologies exist, that can destroy humanity. But looking at the outer context,
the universe, it is against what seems to be the goal: Create life, live and let
live, evolve ideas, life, love. Aggression causes ripples in the fabric of the
universe, and the universe subsequently will push back. He who is in tune with
the universe, will feel these ripples. A human being is only on earth for a
little while. Like a cell in a human body, do you contribute to let the body
live and survive, or become a cancer cell that grows uncontrollably, sucking up
all resources and space in its environment, just for the purpose of growing. As
an uncontrollable hungry thermodynamic process, reminiscent of black holes in
the universe, destroying the host, again, like black holes do. If one than
wishes to discuss if violence by one thermodynamic process against another is
justified, only look at the reason: Is that violence committed by an
uncontrollable thermodynamic process with the sole purpose to grow? Or committed
by a "healthy" thermodynamic process, stopping an uncontrollable one. This can
be reasoned about. But only after having agreed on this definition and
foundation of understanding of the outermost context we exist within.

How arrogant is it of any human being, a thermodynamic system itself, to think
any form of engagement with its environment, any situation he steps forth into,
can be justified with the argument that it is good for him, so what is anyone
else complaining about, who has the right to stop him. With the above vision of
things, identifying first what type of the two types of thermodynamics one is,
it becomes clear if any action is justified or not. One has to determine first
of all, how one is going to step into the situation that one is about to step
forth into. And then realize, one is fully responsible for this choice. Even if
someone chooses to remain ignorant to the consequences of the way one steps into
the situation. Second of all, what the actual goal is: Purely for personal
profit, or to act in line with the intentions of the outermost context, the
universe.

Sartre already proofed that one cannot escape responsibility for their own
freedom:

__*"Fundamentally, Sartre believed humankind cannot escape responsibility by
adopting an external moral system, as the adoption of such is in itself a choice
that we endorse – implicitly or explicitly – for which we must take full
responsibility. He argues that one cannot escape this responsibility, as
each attempt to part one's self from the freedom of choice is in itself a
demonstration of choice and choice is dependent on a person's wills and desires.
He states, "I am responsible for my very desire of fleeing
responsibilities."*__

__*As a human, one cannot claim their own actions are determined by external
forces; this is the core statement of existentialism. One is "condemned" to this
eternal freedom; human beings exist before the definition of human identity
exists. One cannot define oneself as a thing in the world, as one has the
freedom to be otherwise. An individual is not "a philosopher" as, at some point
they will cease the activities that define the self as "a philosopher". Any role
that one might adopt does not define them, as there is an eventual end to one's
adoption of the role; that is, other roles will be assigned to us, "a chef", "a
mother", and so on. The self is not constant and it cannot be a thing in the
world. Though one cannot assign a positive value to definitions that may apply
to oneself, there remains the ability to be able to say what one is not."*__

He also describes the importance for an individual of understanding the context:

__*Thus, Sartre rejects what he calls "deterministic excuses" and claims that
people must take responsibility for their behavior. Sartre defines anguish as
the emotion that people feel once they realize that they are responsible not
just for themselves, but for all humanity. Anguish leads people to realize that
their actions guide humanity and allows them to make judgments about others
based on their attitude towards freedom. Nevertheless, "It is not the will that
gives value to the possibility. Valuation depends on me, that’s true, but not on
my will. It depends on my project, that is to say, on how I perceive the world,
how I experience it."*__

If a person, that wishes to act morally justifiably, faces only one choice: Do I
act to increase only my profits, even if merely partially, but in the end the
core intention being to gain, or in line with the intention of the universe:
Evolve ideas, increase the chances for life to exist... etc. What helps a
person most if it comes to answering the question that is, how to choose the
universe over my own benefit? What is the concrete right choice in a given
situation? Choosing the universe from a moral point of view, does not imply
immediately a clear-cut answer to the question of how to act in any given
situation. Nor is it easy to determine why someone apparently acted against the
will of the universe, against life, if that someone even did to begin with. Was
there intent to act in that manner, and was the behavior even factually against
the will of the universe? A clear example is shooting wildlife, which is a clear
example of explicitly ending life, with the intent to end life, but the bigger
context is, that by doing so, other life gets a chance: The flora can grow with
the artificially created absence of the fauna that was removed.

    Yes... "acting morally", "acting according to morals", I hear philosophers
    already ramming their keyboards, you keyboard warriors you, but the premis
    here is that people have decided to differentiate themselves from animals,
    acting non-rational, instead becoming human, using there ability to act
    according to rational, a set of personal convictions, that act as a set of
    rules dictating the boundaries of behavior, of which one wishes they are
    laws that apply to everyone (Kant something...).
