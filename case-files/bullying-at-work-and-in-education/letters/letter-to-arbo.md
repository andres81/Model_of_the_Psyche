Looking at the increase in bullying in society, for example the increase at
high schools and subsequent increase in suicides, it might be considered time to
change the modus operandi of all the professionals that are responsible for
the execution of policies, and those policies themselves. Who's to say that
those professionals will not use their authority to proxy their function to
give political substance to the tasks belonging to the roles they fulfill
belonging to their function? Or manipulating situations so that they can
subsequently consume the situation, by experiencing power, sadistic pleasure,
authority, social status, ability to have sex and what not.

When are the instructions given how to be a good employee? What rights does one
have? How does the Netherlands protect employees? If an employee does not know
ones rights in the context of employment, this ignorance can be exploited.

This letter is meant as a way to inform you of a proposal to better protect
employees at work.

* Proactively communicate the rules of engagement that come in the form of laws.
* Proactively communicate, that situations within an organisation, are
  non-social in nature. They are never required to be social or perceived as
  such. For example, "inclusion" cannot refer to inclusion to a social group,
  because that doesn't exist in the organisation as something explicitly part
  of that organisation.
