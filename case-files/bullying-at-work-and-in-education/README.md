## Introduction

[Bullying](https://www.apa.org/topics/bullying) is destructive, damaging,
[immoral and unethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality). We had the

## Analysis

### [Student societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_society): The abuse and damaging of young women

#### !!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

What went wrong with the student societies? Why were [young women abused and
bullied](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5440306/leden-utrechts-corps-geschorst-om-weerzinwekkende)?
Were there clearly defined rules of engagement? What did the municipalities do?
Demand at the least a set of rules and a rules of engagement document to
operate within the bounds of the municipality? Do they even care? Does the
university care at all, truly? Actions speak louder than words. Proactive actions
instead of reactive actions, where reactive actions might merely by an attempt
to act ethically to remain accepted as an institute within society. Often seen
as social participation, looking at individuals acting on behalf of the
organisation apologising as if there is a social relationship to be repaired.
Implicitly communicating the view that the simple "peasants", civilians, don't
know any better anyway. Where it is better to refer to the system that is society
where the system should have mechanisms in place to identify toxic subsystems
that harm the civilians subject to the system called society. We protect
individuals from falling off of higher grounds, hazardous materials, dangerous
individuals, but when it comes to institutions, that deal with people,
everything goes. "Let us play a little bit will yah... Traditions something".
Were the "Banga" lists a direct consequence of [categorising women, and treating
them as lesser beings](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5440306/leden-utrechts-corps-geschorst-om-weerzinwekkende)
, reminiscent of the Germans during the WWII where Jews
were the target? Did we not learn anything? It might never have been the
intention, but coming close to the behaviour of which we know it has negative
consequences, is bad enough. The question is then, can you call yourself a
victim of ignorance when you behave as such? Who could have prevented this? How
believable is it, that people really didn't know what they were doing? 

Not taking enough distance and waiting for [the parents to start lawsuits](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5440410/ouders-slachtoffers-bangalijst-utrecht-dreigen-met-juridische)
shows to the author how passive is reacted to these atrocities. 

Loosing themselves in social group rituals, completely hypnotised by the urges
to act social in the context of a group merely due to old instincts, while at
any given time being completely aware of the situation, that this all goes at
the expense of other people. Others are the definition of the
group. The others are the outsiders. Not part of the inner group, that itself is
within the social group perceived by the people trying to belong to that, which
is only real to them. The grand illusion: "Come on... it's just a joke". Is this
what they call [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting)? "We
'abuse'... uuuh make fun of you, because you are part of the group, our way of
celebrating you are part of what we got going on here. Right guys? ;) wink wink
nodge nodge".

Saying "It's just a joke, [calling you a slut, a whore, easy to get horizontal...](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/173036/milou-wordt-regelmatig-uitgemaakt-voor-slet-hoer-slutshaming-niet)
Don't be such a square, you don't want to be considered that dull girl now do
you? ;)" is the same as saying "We are not dehumanizing you, merely objectifying
you as the humanbeing you are, just like you must be doing the same with us. You
don't know us, don't tell me you consider us friends... We hardly ever spoke.",
while opening the door to [becoming the hell you are then considered to be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit).

If ethics are the rules to abide by, to be accepted as a group in a larger
context, and morals that what you truly internally believe is right and wrong,
how does one check group is of true intent

1. Evolving ideas regarding what is morally right and wrong
2. Evolving of rules of ethics, believes of how the group will fit within the larger
   group.
3. Proof the group is of true intent to evolve ideas regarding moral and the intent
   to fit in. The insight of the context, that it doesn't matter what the morals are.
4. Insight of the context, that when non-members of the group, enter the situation,
   behind closed doors, without knowing what is going on, and then being exposed
   to the moral believes of the group. Keeping that what is immoral to the context,
   a secret, by way of contract signing and threads of damage and destruction.

In general, a group that defends their actions, with the argument that they
would never have an intention to act bad, immorally, unethical, while evading
the question, how to prevent actions that are actually in themselves immoral,
unethical and not acceptable in the outer context, could very well have immoral
convictions, but moral according to the convictions of the members of the group.
It all depends on the frame of reference you take as a point of view. The
argument they subsequently might put forward, that of saying that they, the
members of teh group choose these morals, that might be immoral outside of the
group, but that the group should have the freedom to act as they are inside
of the context of the group, say a private clubhouse.

How does society, the social construct it might be considered, cater for the
needs of young women, that join fraternities? How locked in, in a room without
exits, are young women when they go studying at universities, thinking of their
future, and dependent on perceived social groups? Existential angst, the fear of
not getting the guy, the respect, the network, a future with children with a man
they wish to be with, purely because they didn't sacrifice a little comfort now?
"Just join, dehazing nobody likes, but afterward...", while at the same time
the fraternity needing a group of young women to feed off for the prospect
members they actually see as permanent ones. The "chickens" that have no place,
but will merely be (ab)used for the growth and experiences of the new ones, that
as part of the whole experience consume the objects the young women are
perceived as being. The fraternities might argue, they would never do that, but
what guarantee, does the author, a simple cake eating civilian, the peasant, the
"droeftoeter" that he is, have? I simply have to trust your system, that is in
part secret, looking at the contracts new members have to sign to keep their mouths
shut. While at the same time receiving signals from society that things go
terribly wrong during initiation rituals? What guarantee do I have, you don't
rape, sexually abuse and humiliate new members, while threatening them with
social destruction, humiliation, financial damage, lawsuits and what not, if
they speak, ask understanding from society, help for the pain... simple justice
for what was done to them.

[Calling young women "whore", "slut" or "laag wijf"](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/173036/milou-wordt-regelmatig-uitgemaakt-voor-slet-hoer-slutshaming-niet)
, might be a simple projection of men not knowing how to please and/or satisfy
women. These men should be taken by hand maybe to show them how this is done.
Projecting as a coping mechanism to deal with the fact they themselves are at
fault that sex isn't really happening nor keeping the woman interest in them,
isn't the solution. It simply doesn't work. The goal might be to manipulate the
social group they wish to perceive, or worse, they wish the target audience,
women, to perceive, to form this prison they can't escape from, and then to
prevent social shaming, they should choose these men despite the incompetence
displayed and maybe even a lack of personality. Reflection is a thing gentlemen,
if not you, others will do it for you. These antics are reminiscent of what
social groups, communities did in the old days. But back then, it were the older
women being jealous, bitter, vindictive because of the fact they would never
have a young male body again. You want to be like that as a young man?

Young women need sex just like we all need it. How come society is so passive to
stand up for young women and invite them to feel sexually free, try out as much
as possible, before they settle down with one partner, have kids and form
families that form the foundation of society? Need to be reminded of Simone?

Tip for men: The female body is a diesel, not a gasoline. Take it slow, get to
the second threshold of biological arousal and you will have success! Getting
too fast to the first one, will only biologically activate her and top of
arousal, never getting to the second threshold.

### Bullying Employers

When an employer sees you as your servant (see reference #15), you need some
proper defenses at work, not only against the employer, but also towards
society. The reason being, that society pushes people to work, indiscriminate of
circumstances for the natural person, including the behaviour of the employer.
The relationship between an employee and an employer is a business agreement:
The employee delivers a service, and the employer pays for this service. Nothing
more. The employee is not there to deliver anything more, like for example:

* Sex services (Unless that is the nature of the engagement)
* Being a servant
* Flatter or stroke the ego of the employer
* Being a friend
* Socialise
* Being a status symbol
* Being a toy or symbol of having power over other human beings.

The employer might have personality disorders like [antisocial personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder).
[Psychopathy and sociopathy](https://www.verywellhealth.com/sociopath-vs-psychopath-characteristics-and-differences-5193369)
are also phenomena to be aware off.
People, human beings, are not cattle and should therefore not be treated as
such. But that doesn't mean you won't find employers disagreeing with this
conviction and presenting one with rhetoric implying the opposite.
In the worst cases imaginable, employers/managers, that want control, full
control, and grow horns of evil, can start acting to the extent that behaviour
can be called criminal. Examples involve:

* Breaking into a subjects home and hinting to the subject what the subject has
  at home
* Making secret video recordings and sending the recordings to parties that the
  subject knows ( future employers, juice channels, social groups... etc)
* Hacking the subject: Mobile phone, home computers... etc.

All of the above fall under the category of sabotage of the social environment
of a subjects' life, or better said, the mental health of an individual. Pure
psychological abuse. But people with for example an [APD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder),
simply do not care.

Other fantasies that employers might wish to fulfil through employing people,
are political ideologies. Forming a social hierarchical pyramid, in which the
top layer consists of the aristocracy, and below the peasants. The layer in
which the peasants reside, a new hierarchical system arises. As long as the
employer is at the top, he will be happy and able to consume this experience of
control and power. A toxic mix that leads to highly unethical situations in
which bullying by proxy by the employer becomes common practice and because the
bullying is proxied, the employer never is seen as the instigator. He delegates,
while being always fully in control. To the outside world, he might be seen as
a hero, hiring the unwanted, the disabled, and anyone else that makes it look
what a hero he is, while at the same time, it merely serves his goal of expanding
the pyramid at the bottom. The bigger the pyramid, the larger the black box in
which the horrible things that transpire, that the organisation is, the easier
it becomes to abuse, consume, exploit victims to these schemes. People that
depend on their jobs, are victims, prisoners of these situations. No where to
run. And even worse, they might not always be aware they are prisoners and
victims.

What does society do to protect these people? Is it even clear why it is
important to protect people? Or is it immediately seen as a socialistic
nightmare, an attempt at communism or a bad attempt at anti-capitalistic
rhetoric, once one argues something should be done against misuse of human
resources in society?
