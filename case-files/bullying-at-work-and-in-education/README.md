## Introduction

[Bullying](https://www.apa.org/topics/bullying) is destructive, damaging,
[immoral and unethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality). It is bad, at least in the view of regarding the
universe as a place created by, or consisting of the intention, to create, grow, evolve, let life be and exist. Moving
towards complexity, instead of simplicity in the form of complete monotonous existence of pure energy.
Bullying, by definition, which describes a clear intention to destroy, instead of create, is therefore the opposite of
that. The same behaviour, with a different intention, which makes it classified as not bullying, could be regarded as
in line with moving towards more complexity. It is the intention that matters. But that, the necessity of knowing the
intention, to be able to classify it as bullying, that behaviour that is clearly destructive, makes it in so many
situations so hard to stop it, prevent it, repair the damage as a cause of it. While the solution is simple: If the
behaviour comes close enough to behaviour that should never be tolerated, when it would have the intention of bullying,
stop it, prevent it, heal the damage no matter the cost as far as possible, because it doesn't matter what the intention
was: "Hell is other people". You wish to protect people? Prevent them from choosing better be safe than sorry, and
assuming the worst: "The bad intention w√°s there" could be the assumption of the victims.

## Analysis

## [Student societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_society): The abuse and damaging of young women

#### !!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

What went wrong with the student societies? Why were [young women abused and
bullied](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5440306/leden-utrechts-corps-geschorst-om-weerzinwekkende)?
Were there clearly defined rules of engagement? What did the municipalities do?
Demand at the least a set of rules and a rules of engagement document to
operate within the bounds of the municipality? Do they even care? Does the
university care at all, truly? Actions speak louder than words. Proactive actions
instead of reactive actions, where reactive actions might merely by an attempt
to act ethically to remain accepted as an institute within society. Often seen
as social participation, looking at individuals acting on behalf of the
organisation apologising as if there is a social relationship to be repaired.
Implicitly communicating the view that the simple "peasants", civilians, don't
know any better anyway. Where it is better to refer to the system that is society
where the system should have mechanisms in place to identify toxic subsystems
that harm the civilians subject to the system called society. We protect
individuals from falling off of higher grounds, hazardous materials, dangerous
individuals, but when it comes to institutions, that deal with people,
everything goes. "Let us play a little bit will yah... Traditions something".
Were the "Banga" lists a direct consequence of [categorising women, and treating
them as lesser beings](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5440306/leden-utrechts-corps-geschorst-om-weerzinwekkende)
, reminiscent of the Germans during the WWII where Jews
were the target? Did we not learn anything? It might never have been the
intention, but coming close to the behaviour of which we know it has negative
consequences, is bad enough. The question is then, can you call yourself a
victim of ignorance when you behave as such? Who could have prevented this? How
believable is it, that people really didn't know what they were doing?

Not taking enough distance and waiting for [the parents to start lawsuits](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5440410/ouders-slachtoffers-bangalijst-utrecht-dreigen-met-juridische)
shows to the author how passive is reacted to these atrocities by authorities.
Take the mayor of the municipality Utrecht. She would [address the society
firmly](https://nos.nl/artikel/2512864-utrechtse-studentes-mikpunt-van-seksisme-in-grietenpresentatie-door-corps).
Shouldn't you, as a mayor, but also as a municipality, act proactively, by
agreeing to a rules of engagement agreement between the representatives of
society, the local government in this case, and the society? Stating that you
do protect the citizens of the Netherlands, and not abuse them. But also the
consequences of not honoring the agreement. Stating clear control mechanisms,
like an audit trail how every natural person that comes to become a member is 
treated, how they are protected from rape, sexual abuse, mental abuse, threats,
manipulation into doing unlawful things and what not. Protecting them from
psycho- and sociopaths, sadists, narcissists, and other types of human beings
that merely care about consuming human emotions caused by the situation they
create for just that purpose. Or are the mayor and the
municipalities in the Netherlands that naive, that they want us to believe, that these
organisations will regulate themselves from within without any oversight from
outside, society? Trusting also, that signals will come out, because there is no
contract signed by members to keep their mouth shut, if things go very wrong?
You should clearly show
proof of doing everything in your power to prevent mistreatment of natural
persons by organisations, or better said, any entity other than natural persons,
that fall under your jurisdiction. If not, I would like to refer to Sartre: You 
are condemned to freedom. You are in part responsible for the abuse and damage
done to the natural persons involved. In the case of "Banga lists", women.
I myself, the author of this piece, am responsible, to keep an eye on your
actions. I have to depend on systems,
[protecting us from being morally accountability for our actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism)#:~:text=Taking%20on%20the%20burden%20of%20personal%20accountability%20in%20all%20situations%20is%20an%20intimidating%20proposition%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20by%20pointing%20out%20the%20freedom%20of%20the%20individual%2C%20Sartre%20seeks%20to%20demonstrate%20that%20the%20social%20roles%20and%20moral%20systems%20we%20adopt%20protect%20us%20from%20being%20morally%20accountable%20for%20our%20actions.)

Women are not a social construct in themselves. Nor nothing more than a social
construct. They cannot be objectified for the mere purpose of legitimising
exploiting them for sexual pleasure, at the cost of their mental and emotional
well-being. Organisations, like student societies, [might conform on the outside](https://www.simplypsychology.org/conformity.html),
as an organisation, ethics, but also as individuals, morals, to what society
expects from them in terms of behaviour. More precise: How they will treat
women. But that does not mean they conform on the inside. If society trusts
societies, and individuals that are members of these societies, to behave
according to the rules conformed to on the outside, then we will see a failing
system being in place. How can individuals, subject to society, trust society
as the system to protect us from moral accountability, when society fails as
mentioned above?

Loosing themselves in social group rituals, completely hypnotised by the urges
to act social in the context of a group merely due to old instincts, while at
any given time being completely aware of the situation, that this all goes at
the expense of other people. Others are the definition of the
group. The others are the outsiders. Not part of the inner group, that itself is
within the social group perceived by the people trying to belong to that, which
is only real to them. The grand illusion: "Come on... it's just a joke". Is this
what they call [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting)? "We
'abuse'... uuuh make fun of you, because you are part of the group, our way of
celebrating you are part of what we got going on here. Right guys? ;) wink wink
nodge nodge".

Saying "It's just a joke, [calling you a slut, a whore, easy to get horizontal...](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/173036/milou-wordt-regelmatig-uitgemaakt-voor-slet-hoer-slutshaming-niet)
Don't be such a square, you don't want to be considered that dull girl now do
you? ;)" is the same as saying "We are not dehumanizing you, merely objectifying
you as the humanbeing you are, just like you must be doing the same with us. You
don't know us, don't tell me you consider us friends... We hardly ever spoke.",
while opening the door to [becoming the hell you are then considered to be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit).

If ethics are the rules to abide by, to be accepted as a group in a larger
context, and morals that what you truly internally believe is right and wrong,
how does one check group is of true intent

1. Evolving ideas regarding what is morally right and wrong
2. Evolving of rules of ethics, believes of how the group will fit within the larger
   group.
3. Proof the group is of true intent to evolve ideas regarding moral and the intent
   to fit in. The insight of the context, that it doesn't matter what the morals are.
4. Insight of the context, that when non-members of the group, enter the situation,
   behind closed doors, without knowing what is going on, and then being exposed
   to the moral believes of the group. Keeping that what is immoral to the context,
   a secret, by way of contract signing and threads of damage and destruction.

In general, a group that defends their actions, with the argument that they
would never have an intention to act bad, immorally, unethical, while evading
the question, how to prevent actions that are actually in themselves immoral,
unethical and not acceptable in the outer context, could very well have immoral
convictions, but moral according to the convictions of the members of the group.
It all depends on the frame of reference you take as a point of view. The
argument they subsequently might put forward, that of saying that they, the
members of teh group choose these morals, that might be immoral outside of the
group, but that the group should have the freedom to act as they are inside
of the context of the group, say a private clubhouse.

How does society, the social construct it might be considered, cater for the
needs of young women, that join fraternities? How locked in, in a room without
exits, are young women when they go studying at universities, thinking of their
future, and dependent on perceived social groups? Existential angst, the fear of
not getting the guy, the respect, the network, a future with children with a man
they wish to be with, purely because they didn't sacrifice a little comfort now?
"Just join, [hazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazing) nobody likes, but afterward...", while at the same time
the fraternity needing a group of young women to feed off for the prospect
members they actually see as permanent ones. The "chickens" that have no place,
but will merely be (ab)used for the growth and experiences of the new ones, that
as part of the whole experience consume the objects the young women are
perceived as being. The fraternities might argue, they would never do that, but
what guarantee, does the author, a simple cake eating civilian, the peasant, the
"droeftoeter" that he is, have? I simply have to trust your system, that is in
part secret, looking at the contracts new members have to sign to keep their mouths
shut. While at the same time receiving signals from society that things go
terribly wrong during initiation rituals? What guarantee do I have, you don't
rape, sexually abuse and humiliate new members, while threatening them with
social destruction, humiliation, financial damage, lawsuits and what not, if
they speak, ask understanding from society, help for the pain... simple justice
for what was done to them.

[Calling young women "whore", "slut" or "laag wijf"](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/173036/milou-wordt-regelmatig-uitgemaakt-voor-slet-hoer-slutshaming-niet)
, might be a simple projection of men not knowing how to please and/or satisfy
women. These men should be taken by hand maybe to show them how this is done.
Projecting as a coping mechanism to deal with the fact they themselves are at
fault that sex isn't really happening nor keeping the woman interest in them,
isn't the solution. It simply doesn't work. The goal might be to manipulate the
social group they wish to perceive, or worse, they wish the target audience,
women, to perceive, to form this prison they can't escape from, and then to
prevent social shaming, they should choose these men despite the incompetence
displayed and maybe even a lack of personality. Reflection is a thing gentlemen,
if not you, others will do it for you. These antics are reminiscent of what
social groups, communities did in the old days. But back then, it were the older
women being jealous, bitter, vindictive because of the fact they would never
have a young male body again. You want to be like that as a young man?

Young women need sex just like we all need it. How come society is so passive to
stand up for young women and invite them to feel sexually free, try out as much
as possible, before they settle down with one partner, have kids and form
families that form the foundation of society? Need to be reminded of Simone?

Tip for men: The female body is a diesel, not a gasoline. Take it slow, get to
the second threshold of biological arousal and you will have success! Getting
too fast to the first one, will only biologically activate her and top of
arousal, never getting to the second threshold.

Let it be very clear: An attack on women, especially young women, is an attack
on society itself. We stand tall together. Society has as a responsibility to
protect women. Our mothers of our children, our wives, the loving beautiful
creatures that they are. You dare to abuse and attack them, you will feel the
wrath of a community.

### University of Utrecht

The lack of consciously checking what happens to the money offered to an
external party without checking what is done with it, isn't that showcasing a
lack of taking responsibility of the duty of the university? Isn't that then
in turn a clear signal the university is not aware of all other responsibilities
as well? How does one check employees: Professors, security, cafeteria personnel,
all others, to what extent they proxy their function to give political substance
to the tasks that belong to a role that is fulfilled at any given time? How
damaging that can be to young people, whose brains are literally still growing,
whose contact with society consists mostly of interaction with the university,
in the form of interacting with personnel, the rules, policies, the continuous
gaze of these others.

#### Employee Responsibility

What responsibility does an employee of the university have? At the very least,
knowing what the employer is doing in society and knowing if that interaction
is ethically within bounds. Is it behaving ethically? What
are the ethics to uphold? How do you check it? The reason is because of what
Sartre conveys in **L'√™tre et le n√©ant**: One is condemned to freedom. The
moment you choose to work for an organisation, you are part of whatever the
organisation is responsible for in terms of how it impacts reality, in whatever
form that may be. Working for the organisation, is contributing to the processes
within that organisation. It is your responsibility to check if you are acting
ethically within bounds of the context, as an individual, natural person. It is
not called being condemned without reason.
To what extent you really can be held accountable, depends of course in part on
your ability to check and understand what the organisation is doing and the
subsequent impact on the context: Society in the case of a university like the
[Utrecht Universiteit](https://www.uu.nl/en).

If you are a cleaner, for example, cleaning a toilet in the evening after the
author came by with diarrhea, due to a busy week drinking too much coffee and
brown beans for breakfast, you can hardly be held accountable for a policy of
the university consisting of subsidising an external group that abuses young,
fragile individuals.

If you are a professor educating PhD students, on the other hand, or any
professional teaching what Sartre shared with the world, and to what extent that
was a result of Simone telling him: "Non, non, ce n'est pas vrai!", how can you
possibly deny you could have known that what happened would happen? What
[moral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism))
giving you a 100% guarantee, the
[abuse](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5441427/voorlopig-geen-subsidie-voor-studentencorps-utrecht-om-bangalijst)
could not possibly happen, did you see in place to prevent this? Did you at the
least, if you saw one missing, indicate to your employer, to society,
[USC](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrechtsch_Studenten_Corps) itself,
that they need to come with safety systems in place, to prevent the abuse and
potential destruction of young women? Or do you wish to deny your freedom to do
so, denying your responsibility of said freedom, and perceiving yourself as
merely an object in the reality of the context, being society, your colleagues,
the victims?

Because any employee, knowledgeable of the above-mentioned regarding Sartre, to
the level of being allowed to teach philosophy, no one can convince the author,
that there is any legitimate reason one can think of, the university can hide
behind the fact of ignorance regarding the necessity of moral systems, that relieves it
of its duty to protect the students of said university, by way of moral systems.
Paying money, to an external organisation, in itself communicates trust in that
organisation, that allow students to legitimately believe that the university
extends the policy of protection to that organisation.
In other words, it can be assumed students will trust the organisation being
paid by the university, that the university demands a policy extension, and
thereby enforcing the same rules of engagement as the university lives by. This
incorporates protection of individuals and the clear conviction, to withhold
from engagement with natural persons in society, if implied safety cannot be
guaranteed.
Does this make the
[Utrecht Universiteit](https://www.uu.nl/en)
accountable like
[USC](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrechtsch_Studenten_Corps)
is accountable? In the
opinion of the author of this piece, absolutely! But not only the university of
Utrecht as an organisation, but also the
[faculty of philosophy](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/philosophy)
. They could have clearly warned the university, escalated if not taken serious,
to society, and proof that that was done by way of an audit trail on the
escalation procedures. Was this at all done? Did anyone care? Or is the excuse
going to be given: "We didn't know, we didn't expect this to happen..." etc,
etc, etc.

### Society

Because the concept of a university is a moral system in itself, if it comes to
the moral obligation to offer education to natural persons in society, but not
only to a moral system that offers it according to certain moral beliefs:
Education for everyone, inclusion, able to pay for it etc..., but also a moral
system that should take care of protecting natural persons from others, as a way
for cake eating civilians like the author, to not worry about the safety of
other natural persons, like young super intelligent women.

[Hell is other people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit).
How does society check that that moral system is adequate? To what extent is
society responsible for the abuse and damage done to young women, when it is a
consequence of a failing moral system or lack there of to begin with? To what
extent can we still trust
[hogescholen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_university)
and universities in the Netherlands, or for that matter, the west?

How can I, the author of this writing, with tears in his eyes knowing that
young women were abused and damaged, trust society if society is so passive, and
reactive, not even to a proper extent? Where is society so to say? Is anyone
even bothered at all? The answer is yes! Journalists, in the form of
[Rtlnieuws](htts://www.rtlnieuws.nl) or on top of this, as the societal Pit
Bulls that journalists are. But really, are they the only ones? How much should
the author feel ashamed, towards the rest of the world when looking at how passive
we react towards these atrocities? Who is caring about the young women, to
relieve them of their pains, to invite them to society, indicating clearly, they
should not now, not ever project a perceived social context over society, that
there is nothing to be ashamed of, that they are more than welcome, and we care
about them! Now more than ever. They are the future, with so much to offer, and
love to give to society. But where is the love of society to them?

Special forces use the phrase: "We leave no man behind.". We should not leave
these women behind. And keep fighting the fight against evil. The author does
not perceive a few young men, victim themselves of a lack of walls having been
put in front of them, lack of raising them by society, love in the form of
coaching, as evil. They are an easy scapegoat now of a university, a
[hogeschool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_university),
and society, to put the blame on. The above parties seeing themselves
potentially as victims themselves of this situation, which is not very smart,
because the author is coming after them, with requests for change, resignation
of key people, and proof of moral systems being put in place, at least the author
can trust, in order to feel comfortable that this will n√©ver ever happen again.
Of course, the members of the society are accountable, and should be sued,
please don't get the author wrong: They should be punished, and prosecuted.
Justice should be served to the real victims: The women that were abused and
damaged. But considering them evil, as we have seen during the 40s of the
previous century, goes too far. But also, not only the members that created the
lists are to be seen as responsible for what happened, also the parties having
been passive, allowing this to happen, should face the consequences.

The [Utrecht Universiteit](https://www.uu.nl/en),
[Hogeschool Utrecht](https://www.hu.nl/) and the
[municipality of Utrecht](https://www.utrecht.nl/)
have, in the opinion of the author (before you bastards start suing me!
Try me on!), not done enough. They should be held accountable. Meaning they
should compensate the women that are a victim. Not only financially, but also
societal, by reputation, psychological, emotional and educational. You figure it
out how and what it exactly means. But you can count on the following: I, the
author of this writing, will not rest, before full justice is done to the
victims. The women, but also the families of the women. I will not have this!
You have only stopped paying sponsoring, you have waited with that way too long,
but that in itself, is not close to enough.

### Bullying Employers

When an employer sees you as your servant (see reference #15), you need some
proper defenses at work, not only against the employer, but also towards
society. The reason being, that society pushes people to work, indiscriminate of
circumstances for the natural person, including the behaviour of the employer.
The relationship between an employee and an employer is a business agreement:
The employee delivers a service, and the employer pays for this service. Nothing
more. The employee is not there to deliver anything more, like for example:

* Sex services (Unless that is the nature of the engagement)
* Being a servant
* Flatter or stroke the ego of the employer
* Being a friend
* Socialise
* Being a status symbol
* Being a toy or symbol of having power over other human beings.

The employer might have personality disorders like [antisocial personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder).
[Psychopathy and sociopathy](https://www.verywellhealth.com/sociopath-vs-psychopath-characteristics-and-differences-5193369)
are also phenomena to be aware off.
People, human beings, are not cattle and should therefore not be treated as
such. But that doesn't mean you won't find employers disagreeing with this
conviction and presenting one with rhetoric implying the opposite.
In the worst cases imaginable, employers/managers, that want control, full
control, and grow horns of evil, can start acting to the extent that behaviour
can be called criminal. Examples involve:

* Breaking into a subjects home and hinting to the subject what the subject has
  at home
* Making secret video recordings and sending the recordings to parties that the
  subject knows ( future employers, juice channels, social groups... etc)
* Hacking the subject: Mobile phone, home computers... etc.

All of the above fall under the category of sabotage of the social environment
of a subjects' life, or better said, the mental health of an individual. Pure
psychological abuse. But people with for example an [APD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder),
simply do not care.

Other fantasies that employers might wish to fulfil through employing people,
are political ideologies. Forming a social hierarchical pyramid, in which the
top layer consists of the aristocracy, and below the peasants. The layer in
which the peasants reside, a new hierarchical system arises. As long as the
employer is at the top, he will be happy and able to consume this experience of
control and power. A toxic mix that leads to highly unethical situations in
which bullying by proxy by the employer becomes common practice and because the
bullying is proxied, the employer never is seen as the instigator. He delegates,
while being always fully in control. To the outside world, he might be seen as
a hero, hiring the unwanted, the disabled, and anyone else that makes it look
what a hero he is, while at the same time, it merely serves his goal of expanding
the pyramid at the bottom. The bigger the pyramid, the larger the black box in
which the horrible things that transpire, that the organisation is, the easier
it becomes to abuse, consume, exploit victims to these schemes. People that
depend on their jobs, are victims, prisoners of these situations. No where to
run. And even worse, they might not always be aware they are prisoners and
victims.

What does society do to protect these people? Is it even clear why it is
important to protect people? Or is it immediately seen as a socialistic
nightmare, an attempt at communism or a bad attempt at anti-capitalistic
rhetoric, once one argues something should be done against misuse of human
resources in society?
