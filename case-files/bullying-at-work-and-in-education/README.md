## Introduction

[Bullying](https://www.apa.org/topics/bullying) is destructive, damaging,
[immoral and unethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality). We had the 

Loosing themselves in social group rituals, completely hypnotised by the urges
to act social in the context of a group merely due to old instincts, while at
any given time being completely aware of the situation, that at any given time,
this all goes at the expense of other people. Others are the definition of the
group. The others are the outsiders. Not part of the inner group, that itself is
within the social group perceived by the people trying to belong to that, which
is only real to them. The grand illusion: "Come on... it's just a joke". Is this
what they call [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting)? "We
'abuse'... uuuh make fun of you, because you are part of the group, our way of
celebrating you are part of what we got going on here. Right guys? ;) wink wink
nodge nodge".  

Saying "It's just a joke, [calling you a slut, a whore, easy to get horizontal...](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/173036/milou-wordt-regelmatig-uitgemaakt-voor-slet-hoer-slutshaming-niet)
Don't be such a square, you don't want to be considered that dull girl now do
you? ;)" is the same as saying "We are not dehumanizing you, merely objectifying
you as the humanbeing you are, just like you must be doing the same with us. You
don't know us, don't tell me you consider us friends... We hardly ever spoke.",
while opening the door to [becoming the hell you are then considered to be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit).

## Analysis

### Bullying Employers

When an employer sees you as your servant (see reference #15), you need some
proper defenses at work, not only against the employer, but also towards
society. The reason being, that society pushes people to work, indiscriminate of
circumstances for the natural person, including the behaviour of the employer.
The relationship between an employee and an employer is a business agreement:
The employee delivers a service, and the employer pays for this service. Nothing
more. The employee is not there to deliver anything more, like for example:

* Sex services (Unless that is the nature of the engagement)
* Being a servant
* Flatter or stroke the ego of the employer
* Being a friend
* Socialise
* Being a status symbol
* Being a toy or symbol of having power over other humanbeings.

The employer might have personality disorders like [antisocial personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder).
[Psychopathy and sociopathy](https://www.verywellhealth.com/sociopath-vs-psychopath-characteristics-and-differences-5193369)
are also phenomena to be aware off.
People, human beings, are not cattle and should therefore not be treated as
such. But that doesn't mean you won't find employers disagreeing with this
conviction and presenting one with rhetoric implying the opposite.
In the worst cases imaginable, employers/managers, that want control, full
control, and grow horns of evil, can start acting to the extent that behaviour
can be called criminal. Examples involve:

* Breaking into a subjects home and hinting to the subject what the subject has
  at home
* Making secret video recordings and sending the recordings to parties that the
  subject knows ( future employers, juice channels, social groups... etc)
* Hacking the subject: Mobile phone, home computers... etc.

All of the above fall under the category of sabotage of the social environment
of a subjects' life, or better said, the mental health of an individual. Pure
psychological abuse. But people with for example an [APD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder),
simply do not care.

Other fantasies that employers might wish to fulfil through employing people,
are political ideologies. Forming a social hierarchical pyramid, in which the
top layer consists of the aristocracy, and below the peasants. The layer in
which the peasants reside, a new hierarchical system arises. As long as the
employer is at the top, he will be happy and able to consume this experience of
control and power. A toxic mix that leads to highly unethical situations in
which bullying by proxy by the employer becomes common practice and because the
bullying is proxied, the employer never is seen as the instigator. He delegates,
while being always fully in control. To the outside world, he might be seen as
a hero, hiring the unwanted, the disabled, and anyone else that makes it look
what a hero he is, while at the same time, it merely serves his goal of expanding
the pyramid at the bottom. The bigger the pyramid, the larger the black box in
which the horrible things that transpire, that the organisation is, the easier
it becomes to abuse, consume, exploit victims to these schemes. People that
depend on their jobs, are victims, prisoners of these situations. No where to
run. And even worse, they might not always be aware they are prisoners and
victims.

What does society do to protect these people? Is it even clear why it is
important to protect people? Or is it immediately seen as a socialistic
nightmare, an attempt at communism or a bad attempt at anti-capitalistic
rhetoric, once one argues something should be done against misuse of human
resources in society?
