## Introduction

First, it is important to describe the situation as accurate as possible, before
choosing the context, and subsequently within that context draw conclusions.
Any mistake in the analysis of the situation that leads to a faulty set of
assumptions regarding what happened, that what actually happened, including what
lead up to that what was perceived, will fault any choice of context and
subsequent conclusions drawn in that context.

Second, choose your conversation partners carefully: What is their starting
point, point of view (pov) and what do they choose? A Sartrian situation or the
subjective reality they choose to consume.

What is important in a country like the Netherlands, is the freedom of speech.
If people no longer check the validity of claims, start acting on impuls and
based on emotions. Demanding instant gratification regarding processing emotions
, effectively externalising internal coping mechanisms, in the form of
expressed engagement strategies, manipulating the situation they find themselves
in, for the sole purpose of dealing with their own emotions, you will face
societal collapse in no time. It is important that the key roles, are fulfilled
correctly, by professionals, that keep their head cool, and build bridges.
Unites people together, makes people listen, and listen themselves to all
parties involved.

The last thing you want, is demonising one person. Targeting one, to deal with
a problem that affects, but also is caused by so many. Talking is the answer,
not project a simple problem, and thinking it becomes easy to solve it
subsequently.

Let's listen, analyse, and only in the end draw conclusions. Use the legal
system, to ask professionals, judges, to judge the situation, and come to a
professional conclusion.

## Johan Derksen incident - 9-April-2024

### The situation

In the television program
[Vandaag Inside](https://www.vandaaginside.nl/nieuws/vandaag-inside-uitzending/aflevering-vandaag-inside-met-albert-verlinde-dinsdag-9-april-2024)
the analyst Johan Derksen, reacted to an interview of SBS with mister de Hoop, regarding a
[decision of the government](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2024/04/08/nieuwe-afspraken-voor-versterken-friese-taal-en-cultuur),
that de Hoop is not even really a "Fries". The dialogue was as follows:

#### *[Johan](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Derksen):* *"Die staat toch uit z'n nek te lullen? Iemand die in Friesland geboren is, heeft het recht om daar zo over te praten."*

__Translation:__ *"He's talking out of his neck, isn't he? Someone who was born in Friesland has the right to talk about it that way."*

#### *[Wilfred](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_Genee):* *"Maar hij is geadopteerd hè, door Friese ouders."*

__Translation:__ *"But he was adopted, wasn't he, by Frisian parents?"*

#### *[Johan](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Derksen):* *"Jawel, maar hij is toch geen Fries? Kom op zeg."*

__Translation:__ *"Yes, but he's not Frisian, is he? Come on."*

#### *[Wilfred](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_Genee):* *"Hij spreekt het echt hartstikke goed. Hij spreekt het echt heel goed."*

__Translation:__ *"He speaks it really well. He speaks it really well."*

#### *[Johan](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Derksen):* *"Ik ben toch ook geen Surinamer?"*

__Translation:__ "I'm not a Surinamese either, am I?"

### Analysis

Two possible ways of interpreting what mister Derksen did here:

__*Stating that mister de Hoop isn't caucasian and therefore has no right to call himself Frysian*__

Is it a clear undisputable fact that mister Derksen stated that mister de Hoop has no right to talk "about it that way"
, merely because of the fact that mister de Hoop is not caucasian? Which would be a form of exclusion based on race,
and therefore an act of racism.

__*Stating that mister de Hoop isn't Frysian, because he wasn't born there*__

Stating that merely due to the fact that mister de Hoop wasn't born there, maybe hinting at the fact that he in addition
was adopted, might be rhetoric of the view, that Frysian people, are very chauvinistic, with their own official language
, and that that feeling of identity, that experience of identity, doesn't come from living there a certain period of
time. Hinting at ["salon socialisten"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_socialist) mentality of a politician,
using the mere fact that he has lived there, to score points with society, and in particular the population in Friesland.

Imagine this having been the vision behind the rhetoric of mister Derksen, what is then there in the above described
dialogue, that could factually, technically be considered racist? The fact that
[Merel Ek](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merel_Ek)
described, [that mister Derksen did not know that he was adopted](https://www.vandaaginside.nl/nieuws/vandaag-inside-uitzending/aflevering-vandaag-inside-met-helene-hendriks-vrijdag-12-april-2024)?
But is that believable? Each subject is prepared before
the program is aired. The dialogue seemed prepared, known. But even if not, and this was a spontaneous conversation
regarding this subject, the "Jawel" in the answer to the remark of mister Genee, that mister de Hoop was adopted,
indicates that mister Derksen maybe already knew he was adopted, and that he already had taken that into account. At the very
least this should be asked before stating the opposite. If the before stated is true, then first of all the rhetoric of
miss Ek crumbles already. But also any rhetoric regarding the view that mister Derksen stated that mister de Hoop was
excluded merely because of the color of his skin, because it is simply not known for sure.

Johan Derksen has used the remark "[salon socialisten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_socialist)" before.
The remark that de Hoop is not really "Fries", might be related to the thought that when it fits you, you identify as
part of a subgroup in Dutch society, but only to be the politician for a moment. It then has nothing to do with racism,
instead, mister Derksen, saying mister de Hoop is not really "Fries", treats mister de Hoop as a full member of The
Netherlands and its culture, by treating him as Dutch people treat each other: "act normal", "don't pretend to be
special", "you are as Dutch as all of us". The thought behind this can be that despite you were adopted from a very
young age, you might not identify yourself with your adoptive family, and therefore not identify necessarily with that
subgroup, as people from Friesland can be so chauvinistic as can be. What about the behavior of people from Friesland,
(personal experience of the author, over and over and over...), turning their back to you once they hear you are nót
from Friesland... 

One could imagine, that if the skin color of mister de Hoop would not have been non-white, but if mister de Hoop would
have been caucasian, would it have been considered discriminatory. Or would everybody then have laughed, and agreed with
it. Was this maybe the view the audience had, including the other members at the table? Not seeing skin color? Not being
racist?

The point that should be made here, is that people not related to the situation have judged already it is racist. While
in a country like the Netherlands, where the rule of law applies, people hold off on judging, especially calling someone
a racist, until a judge has done careful research into what has exactly transpired. It makes it
event worse, when attorneys, are starting
[to say things are immoral](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5444601/ophef-over-racistische-uitspraak-johan-derksen).

What is moral and immoral is up to an individual. Once ruling for others what is immoral in general, is entering the
domain of societal system building. That is a very complex and difficult domain. One in which one mistake, can lead to 
complex, hard problems to solve. Civil war is always a threat. And currently society has been warned as far as the
author can remember, by experts, that the divide in The Netherlands, Dutch society, is growing, between subgroups. Look\
for example at the farmers protests.

On top of all the above. So many people jumped on their high horse. Stating something is racist. Racism is a form of
discrimination, but what about discrimination against women? Why is there so little noise about the Banga lists, the
rape in female prisons, the oppression still going on of women in society? Why, if it is a subject that you can gain
easy credit for when speaking out in that context in a certain way, you hear all of a sudden so many people becoming
vocal, while when it happens to women, it is so silent. Oh society, where art thou?
What about the "Toeslagen Affaire"? A small minority, a handful of people, kept digging and pushing for disclosure,
where were Mirka Antolovic of Discriminatie.nl, Strafrechtadvocaat Anis Boumanjal and so many others with there
rhetoric then? What is going on with Holland?

### Nationaal Coördinator tegen Discriminatie en Racisme (NCDR)

What is the role of the Nationaal Coördinator tegen Discriminatie en Racisme
([NCDR](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/entertainment/artikel/5444642/racismecoordinator-beneden-waardigheid-te-reageren-op-derksen)
)? What organisation does he work for? Does he eventually work for the
government? Did he properly represent the Dutch Government, or did he speak on
his on behalf? Did he speak on behalf of a social group in the Netherlands?
What is his duty of care?
These are the general questions one should always ask when interpreting words
of someone else.

The only question that should be asked by society first:

How did you interpret the dialogue that caused this situation, and what is the
racist aspect of it?

Combating racism is something done by professionals. These professionals are
social psychologists. They know how to analyse the root causes of racism and/or
discrimination (for example discrimination against autism), and what intervention
is best in that given situation.
Attacking one person, directly or by proxy, passive or active, can be regarded
by members of a group identifying by that person, as an attack on that group.
In a country like The Netherlands, where there is a growing division between
groups in the population, it becomes harder and harder to govern by the
government and even form a government in the first place, it is absolutely
necessary that the people working for the government, try to keep it all together.
A role defined by the government, related to combating racism and discrimination
should never ever let any member of society fall. Did the NCDR not do this with
what RTLNieuws mentioned: "Rabin noemt Johan zo onbenullig dat hij hem niet de moeite waard
vindt om te reageren." translated by Google Translate: "Rabin calls Johan so
stupid that he doesn't think he's worth responding."? 
I propose a "Nationaal Coordinator Preventie Samenlevings Ontwrichting",
translated: "National Coordinator for the Prevention of Societal Disruption".
Let it be very clear, that the author is against any form of discrimination.
Used to being discriminated due to autism, you get to know how evil people can
become. Consuming the situation by controlling and abusing another human being.
But realising, it requires love, patience, and acceptance, and leaving no man
behind, to come together, to neutralise the aggression, not the aggressor, ever!
How can that nót be the job of the NCDR? Do I see it wrong? 

What about the lawyer, [mr. drs. A. Boumanjal](https://benvadvocaten.nl/het-team/boumanjal/)
[indicating](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5444601/ophef-over-racistische-uitspraak-johan-derksen)
it was an "insult", while psychologists are
still trying to learn what that really is, but also speaking on behalf of
another person that it must have been an insult. Saying it was immoral, while
what is immoral and moral is subject to convictions of an individual. Did he
speak on behalf of himself while he was asked for a professional opinion regarding
what is legal and what is not? Is it ethical to do this, according to the 
[lawyers association](https://www.advocatenorde.nl/)
in the Netherlands?

All the author is trying to do, is to motivate everybody, to talk and ask questions.
Come together, please. If professionals are warning for an increasing chance of
civil war, it is time to start asking the professionals, social psychologists
regarding racism and discrimination, to get the job done. Personal rhetoric,
that can become empty rhetoric in different contexts by people that might merely
wish to consume the situation, or for policital purposes, is most often not the
way to go, in the context of a large group, due to the fact of so many different
opinions.

### Mark Rutte: Prime Minister of the Netherlands

Did mister Rutte speak on his own behalf, or on behalf of himself, a social
group, or on behalf of the government?

### "Dwarsfluit meisje": Merel Ek

Merel, Merel, Merel... Being an analyst, please analyse. I have done a little
analysis here now, regarding the dialogue, but you, being there, could have
given the proper example to Holland, regarding conversation techniques and
analysis of what was actually said. A judge wouldn't do anything different.
I don't have time nor energy to get to the bottom of this case. But you could
have dug a little deeper instead of coming back on Friday to indicate you wish
you would have done more. You have the intelligence, the talent, the character
to do so much more. Show us what you got and don't be shy of spreading those
wings of yours! Your so much more than just the "dwarsfluit meisje".
