## Introduction

## Johan Derksen incident - 9-April-2024

What is important in a country like the Netherlands, is the freedom of speech.
If people no longer check the validity of claims, start acting on impuls and
based on emotions. Demanding instant gratification regarding processing emotions
, effectively externalising internal coping mechanisms, in the form of
expressed engagement strategies, manipulating the situation they find themselves
in, for the sole purpose of dealing with their own emotions, you will face
societal collapse in no time. It is important that the key roles, are fulfilled

parties involved.

a problem that affects, but also is caused by so many. Talking is the answer,
not project a simple problem, and thinking it becomes easy to solve it
subsequently.

system, to ask professionals, judges, to judge the situation, and come to a
professional conclusion.

This needs to be analysed and questioned.

### Mark Rutte: Prime Minister of the Netherlands

Did mister Rutte speak on his own behalf, or on behalf of himself, a social
group, or on behalf of the government?
