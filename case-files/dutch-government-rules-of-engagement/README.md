## Introduction

First, it is important to describe the situation as accurate as possible, before
choosing the context, and subsequently within that context draw conclusions.
Any mistake in the analysis of the situation that leads to a faulty set of
assumptions regarding what happened, that what actually happened, including what
lead up to that what was perceived, will fault any choice of context and
subsequent conclusions drawn in that context.

Second, choose your conversation partners carefully: What is their starting
point, point of view (pov) and what do they choose? A Sartrian situation or the
subjective reality they choose to consume.

What is important in a country like the Netherlands, is the freedom of speech.
If people no longer check the validity of claims, start acting on impuls and
based on emotions. Demanding instant gratification regarding processing emotions
, effectively externalising internal coping mechanisms, in the form of
expressed engagement strategies, manipulating the situation they find themselves
in, for the sole purpose of dealing with their own emotions, you will face
societal collapse in no time. It is important that the key roles, are fulfilled
correctly, by professionals, that keep their head cool, and build bridges.
Unites people together, makes people listen, and listen themselves to all
parties involved.

The last thing you want, is demonising one person. Targeting one, to deal with
a problem that affects, but also is caused by so many. Talking is the answer,
not project a simple problem, and thinking it becomes easy to solve it
subsequently.

Let's listen, analyse, and only in the end draw conclusions. Use the legal
system, to ask professionals, judges, to judge the situation, and come to a
professional conclusion.

## Johan Derksen incident - 9-April-2024

### The situation

In the television program
[Vandaag Inside](https://www.vandaaginside.nl/nieuws/vandaag-inside-uitzending/aflevering-vandaag-inside-met-albert-verlinde-dinsdag-9-april-2024)
the analyst Johan Derksen, reacted to an interview of SBS with mister de Hoop, regarding a
[decision of the government](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2024/04/08/nieuwe-afspraken-voor-versterken-friese-taal-en-cultuur),
that de Hoop is not even really a "Fries". The dialogue was as follows:

#### *[Johan](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Derksen):*

*"Die staat toch uit z'n nek te lullen? Iemand die in Friesland geboren is, heeft het recht om daar zo over te praten."*

__Translation:__

#### *[Wilfred](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_Genee):*

*"Maar hij is geadopteerd hè, door Friese ouders."*

__Translation:__

#### *[Johan](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Derksen):*

*"Jawel, maar hij is toch geen Fries? Kom op zeg."*

#### *[Wilfred](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_Genee):*

*"Hij spreekt het echt hartstikke goed. Hij spreekt het echt heel goed."*

__Translation:__

#### *[Johan](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Derksen):*

*"Ik ben toch ook geen Surinamer?"*

__Translation:__

__"I'm not a Surinamese either, am I?"

was:


### Analysis

Johan Derksen has used the remark "[salon socialisten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_socialist)" before.
The remark that de Hoop is not really "Fries", might be related to the thought that when it fits you, you identify as
part of a subgroup in Dutch society, but only to be the politician for a moment. It then has nothing to do with racism,
instead, mister Derksen, saying mister de Hoop is not really "Fries", treats mister de Hoop as a full member of The
Netherlands and its culture, by treating him as Dutch people treat each other: "act normal", "don't pretend to be
special", "you are as Dutch as all of us". The thought behind this can be that despite you were adopted from a very
young age, you might not identify yourself with your adoptive family, and therefore not identify necessarily with that
subgroup, as people from Friesland can be so chauvinistic as can be. What about the behavior of people from Friesland,
(personal experience of the author, over and over and over...), turning their back to you once they hear you are nót
from Friesland... Talking about discrimination.



### Nationaal Coördinator tegen Discriminatie en Racisme (NCDR)

What is the role of the Nationaal Coördinator tegen Discriminatie en Racisme
([NCDR](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/entertainment/artikel/5444642/racismecoordinator-beneden-waardigheid-te-reageren-op-derksen)
)? What organisation does he work for? Does he eventually work for the
government? Did he properly represent the Dutch Goverment, or did he speak on
his on behalf? Did he speak on behalf of a social group in the Netherlands?
This needs to be analysed and questioned.

### Mark Rutte: Prime Minister of the Netherlands

Did mister Rutte speak on his own behalf, or on behalf of himself, a social
group, or on behalf of the government?
