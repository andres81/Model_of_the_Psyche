# Public Transport: Rules of Engagement

Public transport is public, meaning first of all, not meant for only a selected
group of people, defined by a social context, paid membership or whatever
criteria the members of this group could come up with.

To make it explicit how two parties are going to work together, and on top of
that, what degrees of freedom both parties will have during cooperation and
engaging with reality, it is important to define a document called the **Rules
of Engagement**. This is a bilateral contract, that consists amongst other
rules, of a set of rules called the **House Rules** and the **Code of Conduct**.

It is important to make explicit what the rules of engagement are in society,
as they from the boundaries or degrees of freedom for entities that exist or
operate in the context of said society. Entities as organisations, can define
their own rules within the context of the organisation: Code of Conduct and the
House Rules. These
should not conflict with the Rules of Engagement of society, but can implicitly conflict, when part of
the RoE are implicit. For example when only embedded in culture and not in the
form of the law. It can cause friction in society, when organisations start
proxying functions as a whole, or in the form of allowing employees to decide
the policies and therefore allowing employees to give political substance to the tasks
belonging to the roles that exist in the context of the function of the
employee (A bus driver, a conductor, a security professional, ... etc).
This can cause friction in society once citizens hit the interface that is in
part formed by the behavior of the employees of the organisations that offer
services in society. Another part is the complaint department of organisations.

If it comes to employees, that form the interface, a set of rules need to be
defined by the organisation they work for. In line with the Rules of Engagement
defined at the societal level. These rules form the Code of Conduct for these
employees.

If it comes to the service consumers, another set of rules need to be defined,
also within the context of the Rules of Engagement defined at the societal
level: The House Rules of an organisation. These rules apply to consumers and
gives an organisation the possibility to act against non-conforming individuals.

An example of an organisation that has defined the Code of Conduct and the House
Rules is the

## Code of Conduct

*A code of conduct is a set of rules outlining the norms, rules, and 
responsibilities or proper practices of an individual party or an organization.*

---

*A set of rules dictating acceptable behaviour and decisions in a specified
environment.*

So, I think those definitions covers it. Once we decide on a **Code of Conduct**
for professionals working in the interface with society part of the public
transport organisations, not only the consumers, the customers of said
organisations but also these professionals can use the Code of Conduct as a
tool for several purposes:

* Protection
* Standing up for ones rights
* Coping with the situation
* Knowing what is expected from oneself and from another.
