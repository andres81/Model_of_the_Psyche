## Sartrian Torture Chamber

A
[Huis Clos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit)
situation, created by one or more people for a subject or a group of people. The
perceived social situation of the victim(s), is manipulated, to become negative
and painful. Furthermore, the manipulation does not only serve the goal of
making the situation negative, but also consists of keeping the victim(s)
hostage in this situation: There is no escape.

Part of the manipulation that serves to hurt, can be
[gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting)
with the goal of making the victim believe they are (in part) responsible for
their own situation, the said situation being crafted meticulously potentially
by an individual or group, adding to the perceived power or sadistic pleasure
arising from the subsequently created situation. Potentially merely for the mere
purpose of consuming said created situation. Indulging in arising emotions that
are to be consumed.

A feast of created pain and agony, created by as it might seem demons.

### The antidote / remedy / defense system

## Being "social" or "societal effective" towards our fellow human being in society

"Sartre noted when Wehrmacht soldiers asked Parisians politely in their German-accented French for directions, people usually felt embarrassed and ashamed as they tried their best to help out the Wehrmacht which led Sartre to remark "We could not be natural".[37] French was a language widely taught in German schools and most Germans could speak at least some French. Sartre himself always found it difficult when a Wehrmacht soldier asked him for directions, usually saying he did not know where it was that the soldier wanted to go, but still felt uncomfortable as the very act of speaking to the Wehrmacht meant he had been complicit in the Occupation.[38] Ousby wrote: "But, in however humble a fashion, everyone still had to decide how they were going to cope with life in a fragmenting society ... So Sartre's worries ... about how to react when a German soldier stopped him in the street and asked politely for directions were not as fussily inconsequential as they might sound at first. They were emblematic of how the dilemmas of the Occupation presented themselves in daily life".[38] Sartre wrote the very "correctness" of the Germans caused moral corruption in many people who used the "correct" behavior of the Germans as an excuse for passivity, and the very act of simply trying to live one's day-to-day existence without challenging the occupation aided the "New Order in Europe", which depended upon the passivity of ordinary people to accomplish its goals.[36"

## Being human

What makes you human, is not merely the flesh and bones you consist of, but the
choices you make: Are you more than an animal acting on impulse, behavior based
on the emotions perceived, but instead choosing ones direction through reality,
choices based on rational deep convictions, ideologies, 

## Empty Rhetoric

Empty rhetoric: Rhetoric reused in a different situation, in which the vision
holds no grounds, but was applicable in a situation, in which people saw those
that truly understood this vision, being persuaded by said used rhetoric. Due to
not understanding the vision behind the rhetoric, people might be ashamed if not
persuaded by that rhetoric, although reused in a completely new situation, because
they might be seen as incompetent. While, if one would ask for the background of
the rhetoric, and the underlying vision, one would instantaneously see, it is a
big pile of horse dun.

## "Moral person" or a person with morals

*[One of the most important implications of bad faith is the abolition of
traditional ethics. Being a "moral person" requires one to deny authentic
impulses (everything that makes us human) and allow the will of another person
to change one's actions. Being "a moral person" is one of the most severe forms
of bad faith. Sartre essentially characterizes this as "the faith of bad faith"
which is and should not be, in Sartre's opinion, at the heart of one's
existence. Sartre has a very low opinion of conventional ethics, condemning it
as a tool of the bourgeoisie to control the masses.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_and_Nothingness)*

## Social or functional construct you abide by with your moral person ethics.

Playing bourgeoisie games.

## From one-self for one-self and/or someone

From one-self for another: From a point of having morals and abiding by them,
and from that acting for someone else.

## Consumption of a (perceived) social situation

If mother nature punishes and rewards us, has power over us when in a
(perceived) social situation, how much power can an external entity then
subsequently have over us? What powers do we give others, when we allow them to
be considered by us to be part of our social situation and our internal mother
nature subsequently then be activated by the behavior of these others?

## Societal or social exclusion

Are people confusing social exclusion with societal exclusion and subsequently
claiming the rights regarding inclusion in society when the context is social?

I am excluded from many social groups: Parties of families, barbeques,
reunions... But that exclusion does not exclude me from society. I still have to
be taxes like everybody else.

## Being the adult in the situation

In a situation with infants, how to be the adult and control the situation.

Don't ever negotiate with children, instead, go with them in their drama, so
they can safely express their truly perceived reality, in order for them to
vent. Instead of changing set boundaries by a parent. Children need structure.
Knowing that no matter what they do, those set boundaries for them are not
changed, creates a safe environment for them.

Do people steer the situation by playing the infant?

## The choice of a goat

In the old [Noorder Dierenpark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dierenpark_Emmen)
in [Emmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmen,_Netherlands), there was a little
childrens animal farm. Goats and pigs roamed freely amongst the visitors.

![Noorder Dierenpark animal farm](https://github.com/andres81/Model_of_the_Psyche/blob/main/case-files/images/goats-free-to-take-a-break.jpg?raw=true)

The animals didn't have a choice whether people could touch them and give
attention. But at a certain moment in time, a change was made: The area where
the animals roamed free together with people, was cut in half: One half where
people were allowed, the other half where people were not allowed, and where the
animals could take a break from receiving attention. The result was, that goats
would switch grounds, switching effectively from receiving attention to not
receiving attention.

How about humans, that most often don't have this choice? Switching from social
attention and consumption by others, to a non-social situation. At work for
example or anywhere outside in the real world, the realm of society, where
others perceive it as a social situation, or a projected on to others one.

    From oneself for oneself only money for job. But function proxying to from
    oneself for oneself instead of from oneself for another, what the role is
    meant for, is enriching oneself. Not for money but for thermodynamic reasons

not that what emerges from simply living together and the set of choices
relating to how we wish to work together, but an explicit structure, system.
We need to mature, and choose to step into this universe as adults, choosing to
carry society. Not depend on what society will tell us what is acceptable and
what not.

Relating to function emerging from the system as a whole. In case of what people
perceive as society, that "society" is implicit, it is what emerges from the
system, but that is subject to the system of course. But if that system is
dynamic in nature, if it comes to form, and therefore the possible functionality,
then you are not in control what that "society" will be: Look at the WWII...
Make society, that concept, explicit, what it explicityl should be, and then
design an explicit functional architecture to cater for that desire of said
explicit design of society, and th√©n, and only then comes the form, the formal
architecture. Then you are acting mature: not shying away from responsibility,
not going to short term rewards, acting on impuls, but acting on ideals, a goal,
set together:

Instead of the term "evil": Thermodynamically unfavorable phenomena.

    Evil in the sense of evil within this universe. "Evil" as meant by the
    Catholic Church... different beast!

Is evil a concept in itself, which it is, but is it one in reality or merely
a construct of the mind, to cope with the realisation of a lack of control over
what happens around us? Every process is thermodynamic in nature:
[Entropy is increasing over time in any system.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_as_an_arrow_of_time)

Is bullying evil, or the result of thermodynamic processes, that cause a faster
increase in entropy then necessary for the benefit of the systems (humans) that
are causing the undesired behavior (bullying). Gaining energy by a system goes
at the cost of the entropy of other systems.

In other words: At the end, can we maybe conclude that the set of emotions
organisms are subject to are a descriptive tool to describe the thermodynamics
surrounding us, inside us, and an indication of possible outcomes of engagements
with the outside world and the potential thermodynamic outcomes of said
engagements? Including the thermodynamic situation of the system the subject is
a part of, say a social group, after engagements with other systems and the
environment?

---

Function that emerges should not be fought, it doesn't exist as form, which is
what can be defeated, it is the system from which it originates in the form of
emergence, that should be dismantled, gently, for it can have side effects that
can harm other systems.

Don't attack the root problem, if instead when taking away the peripheral
problems dissolves said root problem
