### Empty Rhetoric

Empty rhetoric: Rhetoric reused in a different situation, in which the vision
holds no grounds, but was applicable in a situation, in which people saw those
that truly understood this vision, being persuaded by said used rhetoric. Due to
not understanding the vision behind the rhetoric, people might be ashamed if not
persuaded by that rhetoric, although reused in a completely new situation, because
they might be seen as incompetent. While, if one would ask for the background of
the rhetoric, and the underlying vision, one would instantaneously see, it is a
big pile of horse dun.

### "Moral person" or a person with morals

*[One of the most important implications of bad faith is the abolition of
traditional ethics. Being a "moral person" requires one to deny authentic
impulses (everything that makes us human) and allow the will of another person
to change one's actions. Being "a moral person" is one of the most severe forms
of bad faith. Sartre essentially characterizes this as "the faith of bad faith"
which is and should not be, in Sartre's opinion, at the heart of one's
existence. Sartre has a very low opinion of conventional ethics, condemning it
as a tool of the bourgeoisie to control the masses.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_and_Nothingness)*

### From one-self for one-self and/or someone

From one-self for another: From a point of having morals and abiding by them,
and from that acting for someone else.

### Consumption of a (perceived) social situation

If mother nature punishes and rewards us, has power over us when in a
(perceived) social situation, how much power can an external entity then
subsequently have over us? What powers do we give others, when we allow them to
be considered by us to be part of our social situation and our internal mother
nature subsequently then be activated by the behavior of these others?

### Societal or social exclusion

Are people confusing social exclusion with societal exclusion and subsequently
claiming the rights regarding inclusion in society when the context is social?

I am excluded from many social groups: Parties of families, barbeques,
reunions... But that exclusion does not exclude me from society. I still have to
be taxes like everybody else.

### Being the adult in the situation

In a situation with infants, how to be the adult and control the situation.

Don't ever negotiate with children.

Do people steer the situation by playing the infant?

### The choice of a goat

In the old [Noorder Dierenpark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dierenpark_Emmen)
in [Emmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmen,_Netherlands), there was a little
childrens animal farm. Goats and pigs roamed freely amongst the visitors.

The animals didn't have a choice whether people could touch them and give
attention. But at a certain moment in time, a change was made: The area where
the animals roamed free together with people, was cut in half: One half where
people were allowed, the other half where people were not allowed, and where the
animals could take a break from receiving attention. The result was, that goats
would switch grounds, switching effectively from receiving attention to not
receiving attention.

How about humans, that most often don't have this choice? Switching from social
attention and consumption by others, to a non-social situation. At work for
example or anywhere outside in the real world, the realm of society, where
others perceive it as a social situation, or a projected on to others one.
