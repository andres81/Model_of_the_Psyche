### Empty Rhetoric

Empty rhetoric: Rhetoric reused in a different situation, in which the vision
holds no grounds, but was applicable in a situation, in which people saw those
that truly understood this vision, being persuaded by said used rhetoric. Due to
not understanding the vision behind the rhetoric, people might be ashamed if not
persuaded by that rhetoric, although reused in a completely new situation, because
they might be seen as incompetent. While, if one would ask for the background of
the rhetoric, and the underlying vision, one would instantaneously see, it is a
big pile of horse dun.
