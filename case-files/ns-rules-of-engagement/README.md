# NS BOA problem

## Introduction

The concept of
the [Buitengewoon Opsporingsambtenaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Investigations_Officer_(The_Netherlands)),
Special Investigations Officer, or BOA in short, is a new tool in the toolbox of
the Netherlands,
to offer security to the Dutch society. This means to both organizations and
natural persons.
This alleviates the Dutch police force, that is already underpaid and
overburdened with tasks as we speak. These so-called BOAs can be employed by
both government organizations, like municipalities, and by private organizations
like the [Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS)](https://www.ns.nl/).

## Responsibility

An organization might be able to employ BOAs, but
[the oversight](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0039766/2024-01-01)
is still done by the Dutch department of Justice. However, this does not mean
that a civilian
will
find it easy to escalate a situation that has gone wrong, for example, when a NS
BOA
proxies the function in the form of agression towards a civilian purely because
the BOA is a walking anti-social personality disorder.

## Civil Duty

As with all tools and in the end everything society uses, where society in the
end are the civilians subject to said society,
civilians, the users, are
responsible: [Doomed to freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism)).
If police officers step out of bounds, one can file a complaint, but what if a
BOA of, lets say for the sake of context, the NS, steps out of bounds? For
example starts social abuse against NS customers?
What is the appropriate way to act? What is the escalation line? What is even
social abuse to begin with? Didn't the Dutch government think of this when
constructing this [law](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0039766/2024-01-01)?

Don't get the author wrong, I am merely trying to solve some problems. I believe
that most BOAs choose this craft, merely because they truly care about other
human beings and wish to serve and protect. But aren't they also victim of the
situation right now? They get the blame for a faulty system, and might attribute
it to their professionality. System theory / engineering is not trivial. Ask
the professors at [MIT](https://xpro.mit.edu/programs/program-v1:xPRO+SysEngx/)
that teach this, to people that will become engineers that will eventually work
at Boeing building airplanes with this system engineering knowledge.

On the other hand, one should not be naïve: Walking anti-social personality
disorders are a fact. Only proper filters to prevent these individuals from
entering the work force as a BOA can prevent these individuals from
materializing their potential sadistic fantasies. It is even naïve to think the
intention is there to begin with to filter these types out from the training
pipeline to prevent them from entering the NS BOA workforce. To make matters
worse, it is on top of all this, naïve to think the Dutch department of Justice
has the potential, maybe even the intention, to make sure these individuals
don't become BOAs and potentially harm innocent individuals, looking at
[the rapes in female prisons](https://andreschepers.nl/#abuse-and-rape-in-female-prisons).
While at the same time, looking at the
[law](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0039766/2024-01-01), the department of
Justice is considered the moral system that a civilian should be able to trust
that oversees the proper execution of the law. The moral system that should also
be trusted to have duty of care enforced on the executing organization. But if
that functionality apparently is missing, looking at the prison problem, a
civilian has to go back to basics and check the morality of the situation and
his actions based on his moral convictions, if they at all exist: A human being
is a thermodynamic system and might merely act reactive to the environment to
obtain energy input. But there is no excuse, because Dutch society already
dictated in part the morality of a citizen: The civil duty consists, among other
duties, of the duty to protect the state.

To make it concrete, let's look at system building engineering. Functionality
emerges from the system once all parts come together to form one whole: The
complete system. However, not only the desired functionality that the system
was designed and built for, also potential undesired functionality emerges.
Look, for example, at a water pump: Heat that is created and warming the
surroundings is an example of an undesired
[side effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(disambiguation)).

The system under scrutiny here, is the system of BOAs being employed
by private organizations, and in particular by the NS. The moral of this system,
of using this system, is to offer better protection to NS personal. This was
needed after several incidents where NS conductors were severely abused /
beaten. However, the legitimization of using a system does not only come in the
form of recognizing the moral of (using) the system alone. It also comes in the
form of scrutinizing and eventually accepting the moral of accepting the
undesired side effects of the system once taken in use. But in what form comes
the scrutinizing part of the new system, BOAs employed by the NS, if the author
is ignored by the NS, the department of Justice not doing proactive attempts of
mapping the undesired functionalities and measuring the negative impact on
society as far as the author now can tell?

Example of a negative side effect:

__*If BOAs walk there path, and unlike normal passengers that make room for
each other, walk in the middle and force people to the sides, we are talking of
social intimidation: "I decide how and where you walk. If not I can use the
power
of authority bestowed upon me." This is of course a case of proxying the
function by the BOA, to give political substance to the role of the BOA in that
situation. Which is actually to oversee the situation, for example, a train
station, to check if crimes are being committed, but instead commit social
intimidation and broadcasting the power the BOA has. And is this perception of a
customer valid of the BOA actually having this power? Well, if no one protects
the customer from violence, yes! The BOA is trained in using force, has weapons,
and backup: They are never alone. It is merely the challenge of legitimizing
the used force against a customer, that will let the BOA get a way with it. One
way of doing this, is to first agitate, as described in this example by walking
in the way and pushing people away, potentially activating social defenses, that
can be interpreted as attacks, against which the BOA then has to "defend"
themselves with. Combine this with not showing id or only really short, mobbing
on the customer with a group of BOAs in front and back. Then a customer without
the proper training to deal with his internal world, might find themselves in
the
situation in which the
[amygdala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala) is activated. Sprinkle on top
of this some
[gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting), and you get a created
situation that the BOAs can consume. Presenting themselves as heroes, powerful,
saviors, and what not. While in fact, they abused the situation, the customer,
and the bystanders that learned from this: "I have no power, and I feel
oppressed by the mere thread of suffering the same fate. A scapegoat was used to
communicate: Don't even try."*__

The response of the NS came in the form of the behavior of a spokesperson of the
NS.

## Trying to file a complaint at the NS and the department of Justice

## Asking the help of the Dutch police

The first idea that came to mind of your author here, was to use the approach of
escalating the situation in which a BAO misbehaved, ad hoc,
[in situ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ), by approaching the BOA(s),
asking for a justification,
and if necessary use a civil arrest, take them out of function (by mentioning of
doing so) and calling the police using the
[Dutch emergency phone number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(emergency_telephone_number)).
In addition, after that, sending a public letter to the department of Justice
and the organisation
the BOA works for (NS, Arriva...).

To be sure this was the right way to approach situations like this, and that the
police
would not be frustrated by being called by a
professional [Droeftoeter](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/droeftoeter) over and
over again,
the author thought it would be best to just go to a police station and ask for
professional advice.

On a certain Saturday afternoon, the 28th of June 2025, this professional
[azijnzeiker](https://nl.wiktionary.org/wiki/azijnzeiker), went to the police in
the center of Utrecht, where he was greeted by a very professional kind officer.
The officer listened and understood my explanation of the situation. I felt
welcomed with
my request for advice and felt recognized. On top of that, I was given the best
of
advice:

__*Try to talk to the BOA, and explain how the behavior of the BOA makes you
feel. Explain what you would otherwise expect and desire. If it doesn't work,
and you start feeling unsafe, call 112, then the police will come and check if
the BOA broke the law. Also, the police can mediate between you and the BOA(s)
if necessary. Don't arrest anyone
([Citizen's arrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen%27s_arrest)),
because that might be a threatening act, and make the BOA call colleagues for
help and then the police has to come to take you away.*__

The above is not a literal quote, but an attempt at recreating the message that
was conveyed to the author of this piece by the officer. I am grateful and have
gained yet another beautiful positive experience with the Dutch police.
I am grateful and will fight for better circumstances for the Dutch police. They
deserve the support and help for more pay, and better working conditions, from
the Dutch citizens.

## Conclusion

Civilians use systems in society as moral systems to alleviate themselves of the
burden that comes as the responsibility of taking care of each other in society
and protecting each other: Duty of care, but also the concrete civil duty of
protecting the state. The legal system gives justice, the health care system
organizes the utilization and financing of health resources, the military...
etc.

The
[NS communicates](https://www.ns.nl/over-ns/ns-en-samenleving/dialoog-privacy.html)
they nourish dialogue and respect privacy on their side, but
does not mention the respect of the safety of travelers, and the advice how to
escalate when dealing with a BOA that is proxying his function. While this is a
very new system, of which the undesired functionality that emerges from this
system still has to be explored and described, after which it needs to be
taken care of.

### Interventions

Use undercover officers in civilian clothes or actors to test the situation at
train stations with police officers standing by outside the station. This
does not only test the system, but also communicates to any BOA working for a
private organization: You could be dealing with law enforcement, and you are
in the end, also subject to the legal system enforced by the law enforcement
system.

Proactively communicate to the customers what to expect of the BOAs with respect
to their behavior and what your rights are. But in addition, what to do if a BOA
does not behave: Call 112 as per instruction of the police officer that shared
this advice with the author. Also, proactively communicate what you expect of
the customers / travelers that use the system that is a train station / train.
How to communicate, what are the rules of engagement (House rules that can, for
example, consist of the rule that it is not allowed to skateboard at the train
station). This way as an organization, you do everything possible to get to the
desired behavior of the customers.
