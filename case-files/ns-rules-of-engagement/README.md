# NS BOA problem

## Introduction

The concept of
the [Buitengewoon Opsporingsambtenaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Investigations_Officer_(The_Netherlands)),
Special Investigations Officer, or BOA in short, is a new tool in the toolbox of
the Netherlands,
to offer security to the Dutch society. This means to both organizations and
natural persons.
This alleviates the Dutch police force, that is already underpaid and
overburdened with tasks as we speak. These so-called BOAs can be employed by
both government organizations, like municipalities, and by private organizations
like the NS.

## Responsibility

An organization might be able to employ BOAs, but [the oversight](@TODO) is
still done by
the Dutch department of Justice. However, this does not mean that a civilian
will
find it easy to escalate a situation that has gone wrong, for example, when a NS
BOA
proxies the function in the form of agression towards a civilian purely because
the BOA is a walking anti-social personality disorder.

## Civil Duty

As with all tools and in the end everything society uses, where society in the
end are the civilians subject to said society,
civilians, the users, are
responsible: [Doomed to freedom](@TODO link to Sartre).
If police officers step out of bounds, one can file a complaint, but what if a
BOA of, lets say for the sake of context, the NS, steps out of bounds? For
example starts social abuse against NS customers?
What is the appropriate way to act? What is the escalation line?

## Trying to file a complaint at the NS and the department of Justice

## Asking the help of the Dutch police

The first idea that came to mind of your author here, was to use the approach of
escalating the situation in which a BAO misbehaved, ad hoc,
[in situ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ), by approaching the BOA(s),
asking for a justification,
and if necessary use a civil arrest, take them out of function (by mentioning of
doing so) and calling the police using the
[Dutch emergency phone number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(emergency_telephone_number)).
In addition, after that, sending a public letter to the department of Justice
and the organisation
the BOA works for (NS, Arriva...).

To be sure this was the right way to approach situations like this, and that the
police
would not be frustrated by being called by a
professional [Droeftoeter](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/droeftoeter) over and
over again,
the author thought it would be best to just go to a police station and ask for
professional advice.

On a certain Saturday afternoon, the 28th of June 2025, this professional
[azijnzeiker](https://nl.wiktionary.org/wiki/azijnzeiker), went to the police in
the center of Utrecht, where he was greeted by a very professional kind officer.
The officer listened and understood my explanation of the situation. I felt
welcomed with
my request for advice and felt recognized. On top of that, I was given the best
of
advice:

```quote
Try to talk to the BOA, and explain how the behavior of the BOA makes you feel.
Explain what you would otherwise expect and desire. If it doesn't work and you
start feeling unsafe, call 112, then the police will come and check if the BOA
broke the law. Also, the police can mediate between you and the BOA(s) if
necessary. Don't arrest anyone, because that might be a threatening act, and
make the BOA call colleagues for help and then the police has to come to take
you away. 
```

The above is not a literal quote, but an attempt at recreating the message that
was conveyed to the author of this piece by the officer. I am grateful and have
gained yet another beautiful positive experience with the Dutch police.
I am grateful and will fight for better circumstances for the Dutch police. They
deserve the support and help for more pay, and better working conditions, from
the Dutch citizens.

## Conclusion

Civilians use systems in society as moral systems to alleviate themselves of the
burden that comes as the responsibility of taking care of each other in society
and protecting each other: Duty of care. The legal system gives justice, the
health care system organizes the utilization and financing of health resources,
the military... we get it. If not, blame
the [Creator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God), who realizes when looking at
the author: Even in failure, pure perfection!
