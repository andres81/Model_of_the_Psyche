# Proposal Conversation Facility in society

Hereby I wish to offer an idea that can solve multiple problems with just one
stone, I believe: The opportunity to converse, without any strings attached.

## Target audience

This proposal is intended for:

* De Vereniging van Nederlandse Gemeenten (VNG), https://vng.nl/
* Nederlands Instituut van Psychologen (NIP), https://psynip.nl/
* Theaterschool Utrecht, https://theaterschoolutrecht.nl/
* Dutch Faculties of Psychology
* Dutch Faculties of Philosophy

## Introduction

The idea is, that each town, will have a facility, where two participants, can
semi randomly meet. A meeting takes about 30 minutes, and the conversation is
recorded. This offers participants the opportunity to:

* just talk
* practice conversations
* get to talk to other people they don't know, and receive the reflection of
  themselves in the eyes of another person, where there is no social contract
  necessarily.

The system envisioned, should have at least the following characteristics:

* The premise here is, that both people engage from the starting point of the
  Sartrian situation, and the conversation is an act of going to the minimal
  situation, n√≥t a social situation!
* There should be a rating system to indicate the level of someone's level of
  skill, comparable to the _Elo rating system_.
* It should be possible to get a recording at least of the conversations,
  if possible a transcript of the conversation. This is comparable to chess
  players writing down every move in the game, to later analyse and find
  mistakes.
* It should be possible to interact with trained actors. They can help reenact
  a certain scenario, by playing a certain role, a character, that challenges
  the person put in this situation. This can be made part of a training.
* The conversations need to be monitored, and guidance given, to ensure people
  don't fall back to socialising rituals, which would defeat the purpose of the
  setup of this system: Learn to interact without socialising, social engagement
  strategies.

The benefits, that should be identifiable to make it feasible to implement and
run this system, are:

* A person can become more aware of internal coping mechanisms
* A person learns different engagement strategies
* A person learns that other people might have superficial convictions regarding
  other people in their perceived world.
* A person learns that not all interactions are necessarily social, but merely
  become social when the person chooses to let the situation become social.
  Others might pull them into believing the situation is social, for example
  using gas lighting techniques, but it remains a choice. A choice consisting of
  changing the internal state of a person, in the form of believing something
  that might not be true: It is a social situation, meaning the other person
  also perceived this situation we are both in, as social.

## Motivation

More and more problems arise from the digitalisation of society, with the side
effect that young people in particular, talk one on one, face to face, less and
less. While that, talking face to face, might be the only way to develop proper
internal coping mechanisms, a proper view of reality, our world view, and learn
proper, functioning engagement strategies to function in society and more
importantly in life in general. By running
into walls, we learn about the world around us. Having conversations, allows us
to run into more walls than when we would merely communicate digitally. Compare
it to a spoiled kid: Always getting what it wants. It doesn't get the experience
dealing with disappointment: Not getting the candy, but also not the chance to
learn to negotiate with mama: Engagement strategies to develop.
The walls an individual walks into in a conversation, is the potential undesired
reflection of one self in the eyes of the other the individual is talking with.
Without the protection of a social contract, arising from a social situation,
the reflection returned is no longer bound by the contract defined. Most people
have almost never been in a conversation without the bike training wheels
attached, that are effectively there in a social context.

Another major benefit is the one we see when we look at the difference in
cultures. Dutch culture is very much about making all interactions social in
nature. While, if you would try that in the US, you would be surprised how
ineffective that would be. The common response at least to me is, that Dutch
people then react with the response: "That is just arrogant, they think they are
better than us...". Arrogant why? Because they opt out of socialising with you?
What is the reason they do that? Have you checked? However, if one would have
the experience of having a choice between the minimal and the social situation
engagement, one would start better understanding what actually is going on.
It is time to explain the three different situations, ordered by starting
point, how to engage in society with society, to the personal situations:

1. Sartrian situation
2. Minimal situation
3. Social situation

Another important benefit of training with the one-on-one conversation, is the
buildup of data-buffers. Data-buffers, after its chemical equivalent, gives
psychological safety in the form of cognitive stability, and therefore defense
against psychological abuse, of which "emotional abuse" is a well known subset
of forms of abuse.

The chemical form, comes in the form of putting a base and an acid together,
to get to a certain stable pH level. Pure water at pH 7, can be brought easily
to a higher or lower pH with a mere drop of base or acid, however, a buffer
applied, won't let that happen so easily.

The same applies to data-buffers. By letting an individual be introduced to
certain scenarios, showing different points of view, perspective versus personal
default perception, shows that different perspectives, introduce the individual
to a completely different truth. Meaning, perception is what it is: not
complete.

Reflections not bound by a social contract, are also just what they are: Results
of a certain perception. It is not necessarily the truth. A person needs to work
in that
conversation to counter the claims about the individual that originate from a
certain perception. Which means merely the opinion of someone else of you. But a
person doesn't realise this can be the case, if one is stuck with the view, once
own perception is always reality. How can someone else then be wrong with there
view, originating from their perception? One needs to learn the difference
between perception and perspective, by being put in controlled situations, 
conversations, in which one learns slowly but surely, how to discern opinion
from perceived facts.

Also, if one is stuck with the view, there exists only the social situation, not
the minimal situation, and not only that, even merely just the Sartrian
situation, one finds themselves stuck in a Huis Clos. Others can then easily do
bad, if they realise they are perceived by the individual, as being part of
the individual's social situation. Women might perceive themselves as a Disney
princess, men as the hero of action movies, the main antagonist, and face
disappointment and manipulation by others, or narcissism.
One is a prisoner of their own illusion, which is the perception of a social
situation, that others might not perceive, nor wish to be part of.

This game of manipulation, social engineering games, in the work place, at
schools, in the domain of love, needs to stop. It is time for peace, and
enlightenment. Becoming aware of what and who we are. It is time to give
everybody a fair chance at real love. How to achieve it, find it, how to get to
know other people who they really are, by allowing one self to be part of a one
on one conversation with others. No longer socialising by default, but a
minimal situation in which we see the true other person. Then and only then will
real love be possible between the persons that should be together.

Understand that once you have read this, you too are responsible for finding out
whether this is true or not (something with freedom to choose... Sartre etc).
Merely the argument of this call to evolving ideas is too vague, is not a reason
to not be concerned with finding the truth: You are free and therefore
responsible for the choice to evolve the ideas regarding love and how we live
together on this planet. You have been informed.
