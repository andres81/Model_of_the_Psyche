# Proposal Conversation Facility in society

Hereby I wish to offer an idea that can solve multiple problems with just one
stone, I believe: The opportunity to converse, without any strings attached.

## Introduction

The idea is, that each town, will have a facility, where two participants, can
semi randomly meet. A meeting takes about 30 minutes, and the conversation is
recorded. This offers participants the opportunity to:

* just talk
* practice conversations
* get to talk to other people they don't know, and receive the reflection of
  themselves in the eyes of another person, where there is no social contract
  necessarily.

The system envisioned, should have at least the following characteristics:

* There should be a rating system to indicate the level of someone's level of
  skill, comparable to the _Elo rating system_.
* It should be possible to get a recording at least of the conversations,
  if possible a transcript of the conversation. This is comparable to chess
  players writing down every move in the game, to later analyse and find
  mistakes.
* It should be possible to interact with trained actors. They can help reenact
  a certain scenario, by playing a certain role, a character, that challenges
  the person put in this situation. This can be made part of a training.
* The conversations need to be monitored, and guidance given, to ensure people
  don't fall back to socialising rituals, which would defeat the purpose of the
  setup of this system: Learn to interact without socialising, social engagement
  strategies.

The benefits, that should be identifiable to make it feasible to implement and
run this system, are:

* A person can become more aware of internal coping mechanisms
* A person learns different engagement strategies
* A person learns that other people might have superficial convictions regarding
  other people in their perceived world.
* A person learns that not all interactions are necessarily social, but merely
  become social when the person chooses to let the situation become social.
  Others might pull them into believing the situation is social, for example
  using gas lighting techniques, but it remains a choice. A choice consisting of
  changing the internal state of a person, in the form of believing something
  that might not be true: It is a social situation, meaning the other person
  also perceived this situation we are both in, as social.

## Motivation

More and more problems arise from the digitalisation of society, with the side
effect that young people in particular, talk one on one, face to face, less and
less. While that, talking face to face, might be the only way to develop proper
internal coping mechanisms, a proper view of reality, our world view, and learn
proper, functioning engagement strategies to function in society. By running
into walls, we learn about the world around us. Having conversations, allows us
to run into more walls than when we would merely communicate digitally. Compare
it to a spoiled kid: Always getting what it wants. It doesn't get the experience
dealing with disappointment: Not getting the candy, but also not the chance to
learn to negotiate with mama: Engagement strategies to develop.
