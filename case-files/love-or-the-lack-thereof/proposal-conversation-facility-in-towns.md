# Proposal Conversation Facility in society

Hereby I wish to offer an idea that can solve multiple problems with just one
stone: The opportunity to converse, without any strings attached.

The idea is, that each town, will have a facility, where two participants, can
semi randomly meet. A meeting takes about 30 minutes, and the conversation is
recorded. This offers participants the opportunity to:

* just talk
* practice conversations
* get to
* talk to other people they don't know, and receive the reflection of themselves in
  the eyes of another person, where there is no social contract necessarily.
