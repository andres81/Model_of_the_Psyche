# Proposal Conversation Facility in society

Hereby I wish to offer an idea that can solve multiple problems with just one
stone, I believe: The opportunity to converse, without any strings attached.

The idea is, that each town, will have a facility, where two participants, can
semi randomly meet. A meeting takes about 30 minutes, and the conversation is
recorded. This offers participants the opportunity to:

* just talk
* practice conversations
* get to talk to other people they don't know, and receive the reflection of
  themselves in the eyes of another person, where there is no social contract
  necessarily.

The system envisioned, should have at least the following characteristics:

* There should be a rating system to indicate the level of someone's level of
  skill, comparable to the _Elo rating system_.
* It should be possible to get a recording at least of the conversations,
  if possible a transcript of the conversation. This is comparable to chess
  players writing down every move in the game, to later analyse and find
  mistakes.
* It should be possible to interact with trained actors. They can help reenact
  a certain scenario, by playing a certain role, a character, that challenges
  the person put in this situation. This can be made part of a training.
* The conversations need to be monitored, and guidance given, to ensure people
  don't fall back to socialising rituals, which would defeat the purpose of the
  setup of this system: Learn to interact without socialising, social engagement
  strategies.
