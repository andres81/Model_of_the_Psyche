# Introduction

What is love, and what different types are there to distinguish? If there are
different types, what type fits a particular individual? How long do we have to
struggle, try out, how many chances do we get at finding this all out, and how
many do we receive? Is it by chance, or can divine intervention take place? To
what extent should we let society be subject to these questions unanswered with
what consequences and to what extent are they negatively impacting that said
system we call society that we all, at the end of the day, are all subject to?

This writing tries to find answers, will shed light on the experiences of the
author (whether you like to be introduced to it or not...), and tries to be a
precursor to a guide for young people, to find the kind of love that will make
them happy for a lifetime, not just for one hour of fake subjective joy.

# How to find real love

The guide to find real love, starts with sharing the insight, where to find it
in the first place: In the context of the group of people, that you belong to.
But what group of people do you belong to? What characterizes this particular
group and how does it differentiate itself from other groups? Nationality
(nationalism)? Skin color (racism, more in general discrimination)? Ideology?

The answer is as the author now believes:

* Culture
* People on the same track as you, regarding self-actualisation (actors date
  fellow actors)

## Culture

But what is
[culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture)
? And even if we get a hold on a definition that works to convey what the
majority perceives as being culture, what does it give us in terms of a tool
to describe what happens between just two people?
A culture can exist between two or more people. In the context of love, does the
concept of previously mentioned culture, equal what people call culture between
two people that say they experience a love relationship between the two?
If not, the definition of culture will differ between that between two people,
and that between a group of people, for example a country or local community,
how should we then define that thing called "culture" in the context of a love
relationship? Moreover, once defined, we need to get to work with this
definition: To what extent does it determine the success of a relationship?
In other words: How important is this culture, and to what extent can this
shared culture between two people differ from the personal convictions of the
individuals partaking in this relationship?



## Self-actualisation

## How to find the right person

Looking at the two prerequisites to find the right person for life, one has to
first identify who one is.
[Know thyself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself).
After that, one can start looking at what cultures match the persons own deepest
convictions. This can ony be done if one knows themselves. Once its clear what
groups and cultures match, one can start socialising and/or interacting with
groups of people within these cultures. A persons has to find their own people.
Only within these groups, will it be possible to find people, that one can truly
align with at the deepest levels of convictions regarding the external world.
But that is not enough. After matching with persons that one aligns with, the
next level of alignment starts: Alignment regarding convictions related to
having a relationship and everything related to a relationship. One of these
things is having children or not.

Although it seems simple enough, finding people that share the same culture, to
find people with which it is easy to align ones deepest convictions with, it is
merely a method to reach the goal of finding like-minded people. This, however,
limits the range of options one has: It depends fully on the availability of
groups, the options within the groups to align on convictions, the right
convictions, and members being available still for love. It cries for an easier
way to find people one can align with at the deepest convictions.

### Know thyself

The concrete things to know about one self, are at least:

* Inner, deepest convictions regarding certain aspects of life:

  * Politics
  * Society
  * Relationships (roles, having children, how to love, what to receive)
  * Religion
  * Ideology

* What talents one has
* Career to pursue

### Finding like-minded people, cultures and groups

What are the true convictions, internally*, of individuals of a certain group?
That can be deduced by looking at the goals of the group, the requirements for
membership of the group, group identity, group activities, and much more. And
example is a sports club. The members of the club, that perform the sport, most
likely are a fan of the sport and like doing it (it is possible of course to
just do it, because it is "cool").
You can identify a group also as a collection of people with the same goal, and
by these people coming together, without forming an _explicit group*_, they help
each other reach a common goal. An example is (student) actors coming together,
to play, rehearse, train to become better as a professional or discuss
convictions regarding the art, that acting is.

## A solution to find like-minded people, without needing groups

We need to talk to convey our thoughts, ideas, who we are in essence. Talking
is more than communicating with words. We communicate also non-verbally
(without words), vocally and non-vocally (with the voice and without
respectively). This also shows in part our convictions: We express engagement
strategies with our external world. In the concrete case of talking with someone
else, we display the external engagement strategies to engage with other people.

What also will happen when talking with another person, is we practice to
listen. Often, people demand a social contract before engaging with another
person, under the pretense that without a social contract, it would be merely a
waste of energy to engage with one another, due to the fact that cultural values
are mismatching. While, what really is the case often, is that without a social
contract in place, one cannot demand a set of bounds to the reflections given
back by the person someone talks to, in the eyes of the other. If you talk to a
complete stranger, what you see, in the eyes of the other, is what you get: The
true view of that other person of you. If you "protect" yourself from the true
view of others of you, you prevent yourself growing. But also, partaking in a
conversation that tells you about the other. Do you truly know the other if you
don't know how the other truly views you? Only to find out, after 15 years of
marriage, three children, as a woman no longer being young, he only used you for
your genes, social status, and now, him being in his 40's, he gave up on
you? Instead, if you know what he truly thinks of you, as a heterosexual female
human being, you will make the right decision for a partner.

The more you talk, also increases your talking (conversation) skills. The
proposed solution therefore is, to have a setting, in which people can sit
opposite each other, talk for 30 minutes, and choose between a set of subjects
to have as input for conversations during these 30 minutes. This exercise can
be practiced with trained professionals like training actors, (social)
psychologists knowledgeable about conversation techniques and skills.
The conversations are recorded, transcripts can be made, and these transcripts
can be reviewed and be judged on effectiveness regarding listening, conveying,
understanding etc.

One such skill, is for men, to be true "gentlemen". Being a "gentle man". Gentle
here revers to not judging, because what is there to judge when you don't know a
person. What you can only judge at the beginning of a conversation, or
engagement, are the engagement strategies of the other person. Depending on the
perception of the other person, whether they perceive a social situation they
are in with you or not, they are equally susceptible to social punishment, that
comes from you judging there engagement with you. Do you control their pain if
they perceive it as social judgement, as
[Huis Clos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit)
describes: "Your continuous gaze... judging me!"
Instead, a gentleman, will read the situation, the person, and decide to what
extend the other person is in a social situation. The gentle man will always
merely be in a Sartrian situation, that can be upgraded to a minimal situation.
Compare that to how James Bond engages with any person in any Bond movie... He
is truly the gentleman. Gentle, effective, not dependent on social defenses, but
instead letting all come in, not dependent either on internal coping mechanisms:
There is no social situation, so no social status change, hence, no attack on
the ego. Merely pure engagement strategies, not polluted by those necessary to
compensate for the lack of internal coping mechanisms, and that because of
ineffective social defenses. The strength displayed by the gentleman, is the
lack of reactivity in response to social attacks: Insults, innuendo etc. Women
like to test men, to see if they are safe in his presence. Is this what makes
mister Bond so irresistible?

If men start acting as true gentle men, implicitly to their choice of
engagement strategies communicating that for the man, it is no social situation,
subsequently conveying to the woman, she will not be socially judged, nor is he
susceptible to perceived social attacks from her, she can relax, feel safe under
his wing in this encounter, this engagement, this conversation. As the
conversation progresses, he can help her verbalise her points, showing to her
she potentially has a good point, what that is instead of experiencing it
herself subjectively only, and therefore moving towards a more positive
self-image, a confidence boost. Due to the situation, her trusting her
conversation partner, talking with someone rational, like men tend to be, 
moving towards sharing deeper convictions, those convictions being verbalised
and made concrete, she becomes more self-aware, more confident in her own
thinking, partaking in engagements with each other, and aware of what she really
needs and wants. The prediction here is, that once this happens, she will pick
her partner, not just randomly falls into a relationship, because the "right"
guy walked by and looked nice, only finding out he is no match for her after
that.

Of course, this might lead to a man talking to women, and only experience women
walking out straight to another man she identifies after this wonderful
treatment as a match. But, if enough men do this, eventually a woman will come
to him. If no man does this, you end up with a population of women not used to
talking to a man, not able to read him, only through life experience reaching
these levels, while women simply don't have that time, not like men do.

To refer to Marcus Aurelius: "What is not good for the bee, is not good for the
hive." The gentleman will then conclude: "If I am now not good to another bee, I
am not good for the hive...".

### Conclusion

We need the opportunity to engage in conversation in controlled circumstances,
with the option to receive feedback, engage with professionals in conversation
scenarios to be served with coaching and training. BUt most importantly, to talk
with other human beings. Talking with strangers, with whom one has no social
contract, will give you raw reflections of yourself in their eyes. Then it
becomes time to learn that these raw reflections are always mere impressions of
someone else of you. "Don't take it personally" becomes "Don't take that
reflection for a fact".

In every city therefore, a place, where you can go, for a fee/subscription,
where you can be matched with an equally leveled/skilled conversation partner,
for 30 minutes. It becomes awkward? Good! You will learn. Conversations recorded
and you get the recording. This will serve than as the old marketplaces at the
center of town: Meeting others, conversing without a social situation, but a
potential minimal situation: Let's trade! But now not for trading, but for the
mere experience of human interaction, in the form of having conversations.

Matching can occur based on a rating. Compare having a one on one conversation
to playing chess. You don't play chess against a group (although this happens
far too often when people start "watching" and can't resist helping...), but
against one opponent. If a beginner plays against a chess grand master, its no
game. But equally matched players, will learn from each other, and mostly from
their own game played.
Also, a person will start to see the value of engaging with the individual,
instead of with the other, through the group. To quote George Carlin:

    “I love people as I meet them one by one. People are just wonderful as
     individuals. You see the whole universe in their eyes if you look
     carefully. But as soon as they begin to group, as soon as they begin to
     clot, when there are five of them or ten or even groups of smallest two,
     they begin to change, they sacrifice the beauty of the individual for the
     sake of the group.”

This should go as
[a proposal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andres81/Model_of_the_Psyche/refs/heads/main/case-files/love-or-the-lack-thereof/proposal-conversation-facility-in-towns.md)
to the municipalities of The Netherlands, the national organisation of
psychologists and society as a whole.

The solution offered here, will not only bring people together, but can have
love as a side effect, fighting population collapse and loneliness. It can help
teenagers get out of there darkness, start preventing the worst. Stop bullying
by stop having victims being victims: Strength from within with proper skills
to defend and maintain mental health through better conversation skills, which
give powerful internal coping mechanisms. It's all about the cognitions in the
end.

_*: Internal convictions, are the true convictions, not the externally accepted
convictions of the context of a person. One can say they agree that the
government should paint the Whitehouse green to blend in more with the green
gras environment, but internally be of the opinion, that it is complete nonsense
and that it should remain the way it is now, for one because of historical
reasons. But if the context has a very attractive person, and the only way to
remain close to that person, is to be part of the group, and to do that, means
conveying being aligned on the groups values and convictions, then external
conformation is a choice of action to reach a goal._

_*: Explicit groups, are groups of people, that consider themselves part of this
group, are aware of the group members, and work on keeping group cohesion._
