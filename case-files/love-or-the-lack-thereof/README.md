# Introduction

What is love, and what different types are there to distinguish? If there are
different types, what type fits a particular individual? How long do we have to
struggle, try out, how many chances do we get at finding this all out, and how
many do we receive? Is it by chance, or can divine intervention take place? To
what extent should we let society be subject to these questions unanswered with
what consequences and to what extent are they negatively impacting that said
system we call society that we all, at the end of the day, are all subject to?

This writing tries to find answers, will shed light on the experiences of the
author (whether you like to be introduced to it or not...), and tries to be a
precursor to a guide for young people, to find the kind of love that will make
them happy for a lifetime, not just for one hour of fake subjective joy.

# How to find real love

The guide to find real love, starts with sharing the insight, where to find it
in the first place: In the context of the group of people, that you belong to.
But what group of people do you belong to? What characterizes this particular
group and how does it differentiates itself from other groups, one apparently
then doen't belong to necessarily? Nationality (nationalism)? Skin color
(racism, more in general discrimination)? Ideology?

The answer is as the author now believes:

* Culture
* People on the same track as you, regarding self-actualisation (actors date
  fellow actors)

## Culture

## Self-actualisation
