# Introduction

What is love, and what different types are there to distinguish? If there are
different types, what type fits a particular individual? How long do we have to
struggle, try out, how many chances do we get at finding this all out, and how
many do we receive? Is it by chance, or can divine intervention take place? To
what extent should we let society be subject to these questions unanswered with
what consequences and to what extent are they negatively impacting that said
system we call society that we all, at the end of the day, are all subject to?

This writing tries to find answers, will shed light on the experiences of the
author (whether you like to be introduced to it or not...), and tries to be a
precursor to a guide for young people, to find the kind of love that will make
them happy for a lifetime, not just for one hour of fake subjective joy.

# How to find real love

The guide to find real love, starts with sharing the insight, where to find it
in the first place: In the context of the group of people, that you belong to.
But what group of people do you belong to? What characterizes this particular
group and how does it differentiate itself from other groups? Nationality
(nationalism)? Skin color (racism, more in general discrimination)? Ideology?

The answer is as the author now believes:

* Culture
* People on the same track as you, regarding self-actualisation (actors date
  fellow actors)

## Culture

But what is
[culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture)
? And even if we get a hold on a definition that works to convey what the
majority perceives as being culture, what does it give us in terms of a tool
to describe what happens between just two people?
A culture can exist between two or more people. In the context of love, does the
concept of previously mentioned culture, equal what people call culture between
two people that say they experience a love relationship between the two?
If not, the definition of culture will differ between that between two people,
and that between a group of people, for example a country or local community,
how should we then define that thing called "culture" in the context of a love
relationship? Moreover, once defined, we need to get to work with this
definition: To what extent does it determine the success of a relationship?
In other words: How important is this culture, and to what extent can this
shared culture between two people differ from the personal convictions of the
individuals partaking in this relationship?



## Self-actualisation

## How to find the right person

Looking at the two prerequisites to find the right person for life, one has to
first identify who one is.
[Know thyself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself).
After that, one can start looking at what cultures match the persons own deepest
convictions. This can ony be done if one knows themselves. Once its clear what
groups and cultures match, one can start socialising and/or interacting with
groups of people within these cultures. A persons has to find their own people.
Only within these groups, will it be possible to find people, that one can truly
align with at the deepest levels of convictions regarding the external world.

### Know thyself

The concrete things to know about one self, are at least:

* Inner, deepest convictions regarding certain aspects of life:

  * Politics
  * Society
  * Relationships (roles, having children, how to love, what to receive)
  * Religion
  * Ideology

* What talents one has
* Career to pursue

### Finding like-minded people, cultures and groups

What are the true convictions, internally*, of individuals of a certain group?
That can be deduced by looking at the goals of the group, the requirements for
membership of the group, group identity, group activities, and much more. And
example is a sports club. The members of the club, that perform the sport, most
likely are a fan of the sport and like doing it (it is possible of course to
just do it, because it is "cool").

_*: Internal convictions, are the true convictions, not the externally accepted
convictions of the context of a person. One can say they agree that the
government should paint the Whitehouse green to blend in more with the green
gras environment, but internally be of the opinion, that it is complete nonsense
and that it should remain the way it is now, for one because of historical
reasons. But if the context has a very attractive person, and the only way to
remain close to that person, is to be part of the group, and to do that, means
conveying being aligned on the groups values and convictions, then external
conformation is a choice of action to reach a goal._
