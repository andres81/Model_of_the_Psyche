## Introduction

Public transport in the Netherlands, is offered by public transport
organisations like Nederlandse Spoorwegen, QBuzz en Arriva to name a few. There
are strict rules of engagement between the Dutch government and these
organisations. One rule for example is, that the organisations take complaints
of customers/travelers, serious. If they are not taken serious, then customers/
travelers can escalate according to a clearly defined escalation route defined
by the government.

## Situation one

Although there are strict rules of engagement, organisations make mistakes. The
following situation was experienced in November 2023 by the author of this
piece. A complaint was filed with Arriva, and the author was informed it was
forwarded to the local branch of Arriva: Overijssel and Drenthe (provinces of
the Netherlands). However, the author never heard back from them. That means
escalation time! You do not rob the freedom of women, nor traumatise them when
they are still very young.

### Situation Description

The train line connection between Zwolle (Overijssel) and Emmen (Drenthe) was
in part executed by Arriva with replacement busses. Totally fine. But... In
Coevorden, when the bus stopped, after having stood still for a few minutes, a
young lady comes to the front, and indicates she has to get out. The bus driver,
instead of opening the doors, turns to her, silently looking her dead in the
eyes, like he was supposed to be offended, and replies: "How long have we been
standing still now! You didn't know you wanted to get out?" All the while
keeping the doors shut, robbing her of her freedom after she clearly indicated
wanting to exit. Unacceptable! After this he had some other nasty remarks, to
which she replied: "I'm sorry!". Sorry? She has to be sorry? After this, the bus
driver couldn't be happier. Whistling, singing, cheerful... Because you felt
power? Because you hurt someone? Being sadistic?

If the Arriva thinks this is normal, and on top of that doesn't find it
necessary to respond to my complaint, then it is time for escalation. The
escalation I am going to start, will not be easy for anyone: Clear rules of
engagement, rules that are legally binding for both parties engaging with each
other. In the above case the employees of Arriva, effectively Arriva as they
represent and act on behalf of Arriva, and the customers/travelers.
