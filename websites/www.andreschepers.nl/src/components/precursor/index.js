                , merely the proxies used to bring
                evil in to this world, were disabled. Evil itself cannot be
                defeated. Which is unfortunately a misunderstanding by many:
              </p>

              <p className="font-weight-bold font-italic">
                "What is the necessity to keep fighting that, what was defeated a long
                time ago..."
              </p>

              <p className="font-weight-bold font-italic">
                "Why do we need militaries at all..."
              </p>

              <p>
                Once you find out, how mother nature allows souls in human
                bodies, by design, to become proxies of evil,
                as a society, you can prevent individuals to start acting like
                said proxies. The soul
                doesn't own the human being to the extend that it implicitly has
                the right to let it do evil in this world. Good individuals have
                the right to stop others, who choose to become a proxy, and thereby
                stopping evil itself. Effectively containing evil, which is all
                we can do.

                The wisdom once present implicitly in the minds of those who
                lived through and survived WWII, has gotten lost at least in
                part, due to it never having become explicit enough to be
                embedded in culture, the vehicle that transports wisdom from the
                past into the future.
