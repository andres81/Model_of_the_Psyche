<p>The WWII isn’t over until the evil ideologies responsible for it are defeated. Unlike a virus, that after mutation can make someone ill again, a moral system can become immune from an evil ideology and its mutations. Where the virus depends on the same mechanism to infect, and the cell its architecture doesn’t change, the mechanism exploited to infect a moral system, that remains the same between mutations of an ideology, cán be changed and updated by the ones responsible for it.</p>

<p>Until the mechanisms that were exploited have been fully described and dealt with in the form of obtaining wisdom how to prevent exploitation in the future again, and that wisdom is anchored in culture, we are not done. Only when one can be certain that if that wisdom would have been available and used in the 30s of the 20st century and would have prevented the WWII, then and only then, can one move on from learning from the past. Any other thing would be an insult to the victims of the WWII.</p>
<p>Like a virus, an ideology takes over a host moral system, and starts using it for its own purposes. People can be infected as can moral systems, by way of changing the inner moral and convictions. Outside control mechanisms should be in place to prevent spreading and contamination. Clearly defined output and behavior should be expected and proactively defined, as to have a metrology available to check deviations and early signs of deviation from normal operation. Ethics should be checked to what extend persons are controlled: When acting according to role descriptions, the persons behavior should be checked, not the inner convictions: One does not have to like their job, nor agree fully with why things are done the way they are. Through a democratic process at the level of the nation things are decided and checked, ideas evolved.</p>
