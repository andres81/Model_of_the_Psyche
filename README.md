## Introduction
This writing makes an attempt to propose a new way of looking at the human psyche. It will do that by describing the layers of the psyche, the context in which humans act, general information theory, and more.
<br />
This writing is no way close to a research paper, nor a presentation of fact. It is merely the view of the author, of how the psyche works, and how we can benefit from this view.
<br />
Although this writing merely reflects the view of the author, the claims made will be presented as fact. This is merely to serve a certain writing style to ease the reader trying to understand what is put forward. It is up to the reader to decide on what is true, what is not, and what opinion to form based on this writing.

## The Foundation

### The Context

The context we call reality, is described in many ways by humans. One way is science. Difference science fields study reality at different levels. Maths studies logic applied to numbers, physics studies the laws of nature, literature the written communication, etc… Different sciences, different viewpoints. And this is important to understand: Each viewpoint looks at a different slice of reality. Slices can be contained in one another, but the abstractions are nevertheless different: Models that focus on the mainlines of the subject being discussed. Chemistry for example, is a subject of physics, but only concerning chemical processes. Both use maths, but don’t fully describe the maths field in science.

Looking at the psych of humans, and trying to describe it, asks from an observer and researcher, to first of all choose a viewpoint, a frame of reference, a context. A subcontext contained within the context of reality. What is that context and in what terms are we going to describe the psyche?

Psychology, the science field concerned with the human psyche, mostly focussed on the behaviour of humans. In terms of behaviour the psyche was and is described. But one can ask the question, whether or not that is the only way to look at it. A possible other way is to look at the psyche as it being an information system. A system that processes, stores, retrieves, presents data. Data that becomes of importance, of value to an entity, at a certain place in space and time, is called information.

Another perspective is to look at the organism from a biological point of view: An organism acts in such a way to survive both individually and genetically, as a species. Behaviour can be identified as actions to reach those two goals, or subgoals that eventually lead to reaching the two main goals of surviving. Taking that starting point, how does the psyche and all its functionality serve these goals?

Another and last perspective is a physics point of view. How do human beings behave in the context of physics? What is that context exactly?

### Psyche in the context of the physical world

The physical world is the world of thermodynamics. Any system is subject to thermodynamics: [Quality of energy is lost over time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics), in any system, in which whatever process takes place. This is the reason that any system, in order to keep going, needs energy input, otherwise it will halt or stop.
For biological systems, this is no different. Any biological system in the context of physics, will need to retrieve energy that can be used for work. In the context of biology, this means eat or be eaten.
If we look at the function and the goals the psyche serves, in the context of physics, we see it must serve the purpose of getting energy, or at the very least serve a system that does this. If not, the system, the organism, will simply waste more energy than it gains. Or if other systems are more energy efficient, they will more easily survive than other systems. This way the most energy efficient systems will eventually remain and the others will die out.

### Psyche in the context of biology

Biological systems have to adhere to the rules of physics: Keep introducing usable energy into the system, or the system will stop. Without food, the organism will not gain energy, and the system that it is, cannot keep running. Biological systems therefore will behave in ways to gain that necessary energy. Furthermore, the information that describes how to build this system, which is kept in genes, has to survive too. This is how systems copy themselves into existence. It is the information that survives, and not only the system that the information describes.

The psyche in this context, is then a subsystem of the biological system. It serves a certain goal in this scenario of gaining energy, and creating new systems with the information contained within the system that reproduces itself. The question then is, what goal does it serve?

In biology a system is not predesigned. It evolves naturally, by natural selection and mutation. This way many systems, configurations, are tried out. Eventually only the most energy efficient ones will survive and be left standing.

### Psyche as an Information System

Information Systems are all around us. If we take money from the bank, if we pay in the shop, use social media or order something online. But is the main principle of Information Systems, what are they in essence?

Formally Information Systems are described as systems that consist of everything that works together, with the main goal of producing information out of data. Data can be seen as plain facts. True or false, a colour, a text, a location of a shop. The definition of information is data that is of value to an entity, at a certain point in space and time. Information systems therefore have to deliver the data in time to have it become information, otherwise it is too late, for it to be valuable for the target entity.
How does this relate to what the psyche does and/or is? Can the psyche be seen as an information system? And to what purpose does it behave like this?

#### The scope of data and information

In life a person needs a lot of information. But what data becomes what information that the psyche is responsible for? Compare for instance the information from a webshop, or the location of the shopping mall or the gym. This information comes from outside, is stored in a person's memory, after which it can be retrieved for use. When a person needs this data, and that data becomes information, it travels from memory to the consciousness.

Another path is data coming into the consciousness, from outside. Imagine walking in the forest and seeing the birds in the trees, the wind blowing through the grass. But not at any time does a person see it all at once. The data enters the psyche, but is filtered and only what is focussed on, does reach the consciousness. Here the psyche acts as an information system: Only the data that can become information is let through.

#### Types of data and information

Different types of data and information can be distinguished. Take for example data regarding the physical world around us. We need the psyche to filter properly to keep us alive. If we walk in a jungle,  instead of in a forest, we need to know in a split second if there is a snake in front of us. Not only does instinct kick in, also the consciousness is lit on fire by impulses from the Amygdala. The most primitive part of the human brain.

Another type of data and information is of the social type. Social psychology has this as one of its research subjects.We take in a lot of social data, and form a model of the social situation. This model is part of the information we become conscious about. But not all information arrives in the consciousness. Part of it remains in the subconscious.Where it is used to decide how to act accordingly. Based on this information we can feel shame, guilt, happiness, love, jealousy and a whole lot more emotions and mental experiences. The question than is, who decides how to act in such a way based on the information presented to us, and why? Parts of the brain, parts of the psyche, or by our own choice?

# The Thesis

The big question is, how does it all fit together. How humans behave, feel, think. And why? What for? A proper model of the psyche has all these components described and come together harmoniously to become one whole. While at the same time describing how this fits in the different contexts previously discussed. If it fails for even just one, it fails to describe reality properly already.
The question then is where to start, and how to describe it once one has arrived at a working model.
The best start is where it all began. The early humans that lived together to survive and did not have nearly what we have. There we can find the reasons why the psyche is what it is today. But also equally important: It makes it easier to understand why it is as it is now.

## Solo or together

The first thing we have to identify is the fact that humans are social. But in what sense? Humans are social in the sense that they live in groups. They have relations with other people, to perform tasks, divide the work that needs to be done, and to stay safe from dangers. It is easier to survive as a group, then flying solo.

We have to realise that our close cousins, the chimpanzees, do the same thing. Just like us, they  live in groups just like humans. This is different from, for example, the Orang oetan. These beautiful lovely creatures can go into the jungle and remain there for months, after which they come out and say hello. If a chimpanzee does this, it comes out batshit insane.
Looking back at the context discussion, one has to realise, nothing comes for free, or is in existence without a reason: Thermodynamics will have it for breakfast and clean it up. So if a system is in existence, what goal does it serve?

The system here, is the system that either makes the organism behave solo, like the Orang Oetan, or together as a group, like Chimpanzees or us humans. Both systems work fine, but one might be and seems more successful than the other. Whichever one is the case, the system has to be implemented in the individual organism. The system describes how the organism behaves either solo or as a member of a group, but the question is how the system is implemented: How does the individual behave the way the system describes? Physical: Moving from place to place, on a day to day basis, and long term. Biological: Mating rituals, hunting for food, survival. Social: Finding each other and finding comfort in being together: affiliation. But also working together. People have different skills and offer different skills and input to the group. Using culture to harden what was learned, and to communicate the skills and wisdom to the next generations.

## The Premis

With the previous as a firm basis, we are ready to move forward to the main claim: The Model of the Psyche. It will be presented as fact, and will be fully explained. It is up to the reader to reason the viability of the claim, as well as the merit.

### Part I: The System

Nature forces us to live in groups. It forces this by way of punishment and reward. This by the definition of power: Having power over something means, having the ability to give rewards and/or punishment to that entity. Nature has mechanisms built in to give us pain and pleasure. When we do not act according to the rules of the system, nature will give us pain to abide by the rules. So what is the system and what are the rules?

The system is a group. We form a group and have a mental projection of that group in our minds. That group has to survive as a system in its contexts. Physical, biological and social. Physically it has to survive, in the form of having enough energy input. No energy means physically the system will deteriorate real quick. In a group of humans: The bodies will not survive.

Biologically, it means to reproduce, to keep the gene pool healthy by way of diversity, removing the weak spots… etc. But also: Survival of the fittest.
Socially, by keeping away from toxic and/or dangerous other groups. Protect territory, or fight for expansion. Internally keeping hierarchical bookkeeping in place. This to reward the ones you wish to keep, and possibly motivate the ones you don’t to vacate.

### Part II: The Subject

The subject is part of the group and subject to the system. If it wants to survive, it needs to survive in the group. If it does, it will be guaranteed of protection, food (energy input), and sexual reproduction. Here the needs of the individual are the same as of organisms that don’t live in groups. The difference is the strategy to accomplish these goals: The social animal will do this through survival within the group.

It is important to realise that this way of survival is not a choice at a conscious level. Nature enforces this, and it does not allow any choice to be made to either abide or not. Because of this, nature in this context, will favour the group over the individual. This is not exposed through group decisions, although it happens, but moreover through for example the fact that both humans and chimpanzees won’t remain mentally healthy if not living with others, but instead wander alone through the forest or jungle.

### Part III: The implementation

But how are these two systems, the group level system and the subject level system, implemented? Where are they built, configured, and physically represented? The only place it can be residing is in the subjects themselves. Through behaviour the system exposes itself. Through behaviour the system itself is maintained, by the subjects that are subject to these systems.

To start seeing the mechanisms in place, we should work with an abstraction that will leave the details behind, and try to find a description of a system, least energy intensive, that fits the description of the previously described group system. We can arrive at this model, an abstraction, by posing a problem in the form of a set of requirements for a system we are supposed to build. The problem is then, what system solves the problem of having individual nodes, work together as a group, identify as such, and maintain the group at the group level?

For this lets first recap the requirements:

1. The system has to be regulated and implemented through the nodes subject to it.
2. The system has as a main purpose, to survive in the different contexts.

Let us first explore the main purpose of the system. The perspective we have to use is of the system. The system will be posed with problems it needs to solve, in order to reach its goals. If we make an inventory of the problems it needs to solve, we get a better grip on the requirements that need to be fulfilled, in order to fulfil the requirement of being able to survive.

1. Physical
    1. Be healthy and strong
2. Biological
    1. Replenish nodes that will die eventually: Reproduction.
    2. Only reproduce healthy new nodes: Favour the strong, healthy, skilled.
    3. Remove weak, toxic, sick nodes to prevent unfavourable reproduction.
3. Social
    1. To survive socially, against other clans, tribes, groups, the group has
       to form one front to defend in the most effective way possible.
    2. It has to present itself as being qualitatively favourable over others
       (status): Healthy genes are attracted residing in nodes looking for a
       group, tribe, clan. Or to prevent healthy nodes from leaving the group.
    3. How to maintain hierarchy, how to do the bookkeeping and align this
       between the nodes. There needs to be a system in place and a way of
       communicating it between the nodes of the system.

It is now clear what problems the group has to overcome. Now it is time to see what mechanisms we can identify that will aid in enforcing the actions like 2.2, or 3.3. As mentioned previously, the group is maintained through the nodes. The nodes themselves implement the system and through the behaviour of nodes, the system can act. Another side to this, is that the system can also only perceive the situation through the nodes.

#### Directing of nodes

The only way of reaching the goals of the system is by the motivation of the individual nodes.
If the individual nodes in the system act the right way, it will work towards reaching
the goals of the system. But the question then is, how to motivate individual nodes
just the right way?
As described previously, power is described in terms of being able to reward or punish. Through reward and/or punishment, a node can be motivated to reach certain goals, or move in a certain direction. The node does not have to be aware of the goals of the system, it just
acts in a way dictated by the net result of the total reward and punishment it
receives.

But how can the system reward and/or punish nodes? Also, how can it punish, without realising the opposite: Motivating the node to move out of the system to no longer experience the punishment? If the system punishes, a motivation to move away starts. But if another motivation is also acting upon the node, in the opposite direction and stronger, the net result is that the node will wish to remain within the group, and act exactly as is needed to have
the goals of the system reached.

The question then becomes, what are the rewards and punishments? In what form do they come and under what circumstances? What should be rewarded and what should be punished?

#### The What

As indicated, the system has goals to achieve, in order to survive. The nodes, however have
to act to get this done. We have to do some bookkeeping now to get an idea what the nodes
have to do, in order for the system to achieve individual goals.

#### The How

But how to get the what? The way the psyche as a system gets the what done, is
through emotions. Shame, insult, feelings of exclusion, low self esteem, etc...
But also strong fear if the thread exists of being thrown out of the group: Group survival
is physical survival. Here in lies also a hint for social defenses: If someone
tries to insult you, but you don't consider them part of your clan, tribe or group,
that individual can use anything but won't be able to make you feel insulted!

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

#### 0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

#### 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers
to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,
and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify
or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be
at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

#### 2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

#### 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you
as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the
full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.
You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with
changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of
the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.

#### 4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

-   A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
    distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
    versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
    History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a
    previous version if the original publisher of that version
    gives permission.
-   B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
    entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
    Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
    authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
    fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
-   C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
    Modified Version, as the publisher.
-   D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
-   E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
    adjacent to the other copyright notices.
-   F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
    notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
    under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the
    Addendum below.
-   G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
    Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
    license notice.
-   H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
-   I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
    and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
    authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
    Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
    Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
    publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an
    item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
    previous sentence.
-   J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
    for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
    likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
    versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History"
    section. You may omit a network location for a work that was
    published at least four years before the Document itself, or if
    the original publisher of the version it refers to
    gives permission.
-   K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
    Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
    the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
    and/or dedications given therein.
-   L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
    in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
    equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
-   M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may
    not be included in the Modified Version.
-   N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
    "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
-   O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
partiesâ€”for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

#### 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".

#### 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.

#### 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

#### 8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

#### 9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

#### 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns. See
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies
that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be
used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

#### 11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

### ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

        Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
        Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
        under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
        or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
        with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
        A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
        Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with â€¦ Texts." line with this:

        with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
